Do you like this house?
Yes, it's beautiful.
It's perfect for us and the kids.
Three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a big back yard.
And we can afford it!
So are we going to buy it?
I'm afraid not.
It's too far from your job, isn't it?
I can't spend four hours on the road every day.
By the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat.
I won't be able to play with the kids.
No, we have to find something closer to your job.
Have you decided how you are going to vote?
Do you mean on Measures 1, 2, and 3?
Yes. The ones that will improve our schools, roads, and hospitals.
You mean the measures that will raise our taxes.
But the TV ads say that our taxes will not increase.
Do you believe the TV ads?
I like the one where the fireman tells us why we should vote Yes.
Don't believe him! Whatever the TV ads tell you, the opposite is true.
But the title of Measure 1 is "Better Schools at No Cost."
The title should be "Better Schools at Huge Cost."
I can't believe that they would lie to us.
Of course they lie—that's what politicians do!
Who did you vote for?
I voted for Obama.
Me too.
He will be a great president.
Everyone likes him.
He's a good speaker.
And he's really smart.
He will solve our problems.
He will end the war.
The next four years will be good years.
I'll vote for him next time, too.
I think everyone will.
The election is next week.
Who are you voting for?
I'm not voting for the mayor.
Why not?
He made promises that he didn't keep.
Like what?
He promised to hire 1,000 more police officers.
How many did he hire?
One hundred!
Maybe he had a good reason.
Maybe he's just a liar.
Maybe I'll vote for someone else, too.
I can't believe he won the election.
Only 15 percent of the voters turned out.
That is a joke.
Voting is so important, but people don't bother.
Many people think their vote doesn't matter.
The mayor won by only 2,000 votes.
We're stuck with him for four more years.
Voting is so easy. You can even mail your ballot in.
All you have to do is vote and put a stamp on it.
How easy is that?
I guess people just don't care.
They'll care when they see their taxes go up.
Well, we have a new president.
But we have the same old problems.
Well, he's made a few changes.
Like what?
I think he closed the bowling alley in the White House.
Oh, yeah. He's changing it to a basketball court.
Who's paying for that?
I think we are!
Well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.
Yes, we need a relaxed president who thinks clearly.
Do any other world leaders have a basketball court?
They will. You know America always leads the way.
People say that everybody loves Obama.
Well, more than 50 million people voted for McCain.
That's 50 million people who don't love Obama.
Obama's got four years to make everyone happy.
He's never going to make everyone happy.
Can you imagine being President?
Everyone wants you to solve their problems.
I have enough stress from trying to solve my own problems.
You and everybody else.
I would never want to be President.
But think about all the power you'd have.
I prefer my quiet little life to all the power in the world.
Did you read this article?
What article?
It says the mayor spends only 11 percent of his time on city duties.
Only 11 percent?
About 50 percent of the time he's traveling.
Where does he travel to?
Oh, all over the world.
But he's supposed to be making our city a better place.
He's visiting other cities to get ideas.
Can't he just go online?
The rest of the time he's raising money for his reelection.
Well, he'll never get reelected once this news gets out.
Who did you vote for for president?
I voted for Ralph Nader.
Who in the world is Ralph Nader?
He's the best man for president.
Why's that?
He hates corporations.
Well, most corporations do think only about money.
He hates Democrats and Republicans.
Well, they do put their party before their country.
He's the only candidate that I trust.
But he didn't have a chance. Nobody voted for him!
Sooner or later, voters will wake up.
I don't know why I bother to vote.
Why's that?
What good does it do?
You get to put someone in power that you like.
Only if my candidate wins.
Well, he can't win unless you and others vote for him.
But even if my candidate wins, he'll break his promises.
That's true. They promise anything just so they get elected.
And when elected, they go their own way.
They forget who put them in power.
They forget where they came from.
Maybe you should run for office.
That election for U.S. Senator stunk.
What do you mean?
There were more votes than voters!
But that's impossible.
Officials said that it's possible.
Did they explain how it's possible?
No. They said there are some things you can't explain.
So are they going to hold another election?
No. That will cost too much money.
So it's better to save money than to have an honest election?
Well, the Democratic Party says it was an honest election.
Of course they say that—their man won!
I see that former President Bush is at a conference.
Yes. He's telling jokes about his eight years as president.
Yes, those eight years were a lot of fun for everyone.
Only 4,000 American soldiers were killed overseas.
Not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers.
But Bush visited some of them in the hospital once.
That's nice that he found the time to make a visit.
He spoke to them and made them feel better.
Did he speak to every family that lost a soldier?
No, he didn't have time to do that.
Well, he's got plenty of time now!
No, he's too busy writing a book about how hard it was to be president.
Did you get your Official Sample Ballot?
Yes, with the Voter Instructions.
How are you going to vote?
Same as ever, by mail. All it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.
I meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?
Against all of them, of course.
But we need new taxes to pay for highways, schools, and prisons.
We've already voted for new taxes to pay for all that stuff!
That's true. Where did that money go?
Our legislators spent it on first-class travel all over the world.
They are having a good time with our money.
So when are we going to stop giving them more?
I have a stomachache.
Is it something you ate?
Maybe. I'm not sure.
What did you have for breakfast?
The usual, cereal with milk and a banana.
Maybe the milk was bad.
It didn't smell bad.
Maybe the banana was bad.
No, the banana was delicious.
Maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.
No, that's not the problem.
Maybe it will go away in a little while.
What's this stain?
I don't know.
It looks like blood.
I think my nose was bleeding.
You should wet your shirt immediately.
Why?
Because that gets the blood out of the shirt.
What's a little blood?
Your white shirt is ruined.
So, I'll just buy another one.
You can wear this one around the house.
Next time I'll soak it immediately.
My fingers hurt.
Why do they hurt?
I type too much.
You should take a break.
I need to type to make money.
But typing is causing you pain.
Maybe I should see a doctor.
Doctors are too expensive.
He might tell me to rest for a while.
He might want to cut you open.
He might say I'm okay.
He might say you have bone cancer.
What did the doctor say?
He thinks I have too much stress.
Stress causes your stomachaches?
Stress causes different problems with different people.
So what did he tell you to do?
He said I need to think positive.
He didn't give you any medication?
I hate medication. It makes me feel different.
So how do you think positive?
I think about nice things.
Like what?
Like a day at the beach, with my toes in the sand.
I cut my finger.
How did you do that?
It's a paper cut.
Paper can be dangerous.
It hurts, too.
Paper cuts can hurt a lot.
Where are the band-aids?
I think they're in the medicine cabinet.
It's on the tip of my finger.
A band-aid might not work.
I must not use this finger until the cut heals.
It might take a day or two to heal.
Do you smell that?
Oh, yes.
I can't stand cigarette smoke.
It smells so bad.
One cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk.
Smokers think they are so cool.
They are so weak.
A little cigarette controls them.
They look so stupid taking a puff.
And then they blow smoke out of their mouth.
They think it's cool.
Cigarettes stink.
Do you have a cold?
Yes, I do.
How did you get it?
My sister had a cold. She gave it to me.
Have you taken anything for your cold?
No, I just blow my nose a lot.
Your nose is stopped up?
Yes. I have to breathe through my mouth.
Have you tried nose drops?
No, I don't like nose drops.
They work great.
I don't care. I don't like to put drops in my nose.
Would you put suntan lotion on my back, please?
Sure.
Thank you.
You shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.
I want to get a tan. I don't want to look so pale.
What's wrong with looking pale?
People think you might be sick.
Who thinks that?
I don't know.
It's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.
I know that.
So why are you arguing with me? Don't lie in the sun too long!
I can't quit smoking.
Of course you can.
I don't have enough will power.
Of course you do.
I wish I had never started.
So does every smoker.
I've tried to quit so many times.
So has everyone else.
Nothing seems to work.
All it takes is will power and you have it.
Then why can't I quit?
You have to believe in yourself.
My back is killing me.
What did you do?
I got out of my car.
That's it?
I injured my back one time just by sneezing.
You should see a doctor.
My doctor said I need surgery.
So?
So, forget it.
You don't have the money?
I have no insurance.
Maybe a back rub would help.
My brother smokes three packs a day.
Three packs of what?
Cigarettes, of course.
How can he do that?
When he is almost finished with one cigarette, he uses it to light another.
He's a chain smoker.
He's been a chain smoker for 30 years.
That's unbelievable. Can he still breathe?
He can, but the people around him can't.
How can he still be alive?
His doctor says his heart and lungs are strong and healthy.
Maybe I should start smoking.
I hate brushing my teeth.
It's such a chore.
Brush, brush. Spit, spit.
What did they do in the old days?
They brushed with their fingers.
They also ate with their fingers!
Why do they call it the good old days?
Maybe because they didn't have to brush and floss.
Who invented flossing?
A dentist, I'm sure.
I hate flossing more than brushing!
I can't wait till all my teeth fall out.
Let's stop for a while. I need a break and some water.
This trail is hard to climb.
Especially on a hot day like this.
I can't believe we haven't seen any animals.
Thank goodness! I don't want to see any wild animals.
All we've seen so far is a couple of lizards.
We're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears.
I bet I've lost a couple of pounds already.
All you've lost is some sweat.
I haven't even lost one pound of fat?
If you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day.
Okay, but let's hike in town. At least there are cats and dogs to see.
Oh no, another pimple on my face.
Pimples suck.
It seems like I get a new pimple almost every day.
Maybe it's something in your diet.
No, I eat the same things day after day.
Then maybe it's in your genes.
You might be right.
Do pimples run in your family?
Not that I've noticed.
Well, maybe it's from the pollution in the air.
Whatever the cause, I hate seeing them on my face.
Well, on the bright side, they're fun to pop.
Do you believe everything you hear?
I don't believe anything I don't see with my own eyes.
You can't believe what you hear on TV or radio.
You can't believe what you read in the newspapers.
Everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.
Three different people will give you three different stories.
And the government will give you a fourth story.
Yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu.
But the swine flu just killed 20 people in Mexico.
The government says we have nothing to worry about.
Then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home?
The government says to wash our hands frequently, and we'll all be okay.
Don't pick your nose.
I wasn't picking my nose.
What were you doing?
I was scratching my nose.
I think I know the difference between picking and scratching.
Okay, mom, maybe I was picking it a little bit.
Use a tissue next time.
I didn't have a tissue.
Then wait till you find a tissue.
I couldn't wait. It was an emergency.
Oh, really? Maybe you should have called 911.
It wasn't that kind of emergency.
Our TV remote is filthy.
Yes, it's covered with crud.
I'm going to clean it.
Don't use water on it!
I'll use a damp cloth.
Don't let water get into any of the cracks.
I'll squeeze the cloth so it's almost dry.
Don't rub the numbers off the remote.
I will rub gently but firmly.
Do it quickly, please, so I can change channels during commercials.
I'll give it back to you in a couple of minutes.
Maybe we should put it in a plastic bag to keep it clean.
My ear is killing me.
What's the matter?
I was on a plane.
So?
So, every time the plane goes up, my ear starts to hurt.
That's no good.
Sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't.
Have you seen a doctor?
I've been to two doctors.
And they couldn't fix your problem?
They both said I have to live with it.
Or you can stay off planes.
Did you see the woman with the new face?
Did she get a nice job?
She got an "everything" job!
What do you mean?
A team of doctors gave her a whole new face.
Why did they do that?
A mad dog bit most of her face off.
Oh, that's terrible. What does she look like now?
Her face is really fat, but they say the swelling will go down.
And then will she look normal again?
I guess so.
God bless modern medicine.
There's something wrong with my right hand.
What's wrong with it?
It aches most of the time.
What do you think it is?
I don't know. I think it's old age.
If it's old age, why don't both of your hands hurt?
That's a good question. Maybe it's not old age.
Are you right-handed?
Yes. All my life.
You're wearing out your right hand. Stop using it so much.
But I do all my writing with my right hand.
Start typing instead. That way your left hand will do half the work.
That was a great trip to Washington, D.C.
Tell me about it, Dad.
About 90 of us World War II veterans got on the plane at 8 a.m.
How long was the flight?
It only took about two hours.
Did you take pictures at the World War II Monument?
Oh, yes. We all took lots of pictures.
Then you flew back home that evening?
Yes. When we landed, TV reporters and the Army band were there.
That must have made you feel really special.
Oh, it did. There were about 300 people there to honor us.
Well, you all deserve it. You helped save our country.
I went to Hawaii on vacation.
Did you like it?
I loved it. I want to live there.
What did you like?
The island is so green, and the water is so blue.
Did you go swimming?
I went to the beach every day.
How was the weather?
It was hot and sunny every day.
What did you do at night?
At night I went out to eat. The food was delicious.
People who live in Hawaii are lucky.
I like this hotel.
What do you like about it?
We get a free breakfast.
Coffee and a roll?
No, a real breakfast.
Bacon and eggs?
With toast, ham, sausage, fresh fruit, and juice.
Wow! That is nice. Let's stay for two nights.
And the rooms are clean, too.
Do they allow pets?
No pets, no smoking.
I like that. Let's stay three nights.
I'm not sleeping here tonight.
What's the matter? This is a nice room.
Maybe the room is nice, but not the bed.
What's wrong with the bed?
Look at this sheet.
Yes?
See those stains?
I sure do.
I'm not sleeping on that sheet.
Well, just call the front desk. They'll give us new sheets.
I want sheets without stains on them.
From now on, let's bring our own sheets.
What time does your plane leave?
It leaves at 12:15.
When do you have to be at the airport?
I have to be there two hours early.
So we have to be at the airport at 10:15.
That means we have to leave the house at 9:15.
Well, it's an hour to get there, if there are no traffic problems.
So maybe we better leave at 8:15?
Yes, it's better to get there too early than too late.
I agree.
You never know what might happen on these freeways.
There's at least one huge accident every day.
I need to fly to New York.
When are you going?
During the Christmas holidays.
You'd better buy your ticket now.
You must be kidding.
No, I'm not. It's March. Time is running out. Seats are selling out right now.
I thought I would wait until October.
I'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during Christmas.
You're right.
Well, listen to me. You need to buy a ticket now.
But maybe prices will be cheaper in October.
Cheaper prices won't do you any good if there are no seats.
I need to fly to New York.
When are you going?
During the Christmas holidays.
You'd better buy your ticket now.
You must be kidding.
No, I'm not. It's March. Time is running out. Seats are selling out right now.
I thought I would wait until October.
I'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during Christmas.
You're right.
Well, listen to me. You need to buy a ticket now.
But maybe prices will be cheaper in October.
Cheaper prices won't do you any good if there are no seats.
I hate flying.
So do I.
A long time ago, flying used to be okay.
Now it's like riding a bus.
You're jammed in with people all around you.
Half of them are coughing, and the other half are sneezing.
You don't have any elbow room or knee room.
People are always getting up to use the bathroom.
Kids are crying or climbing over you.
It's a flying zoo!
I wish I could afford first class seats.
Doesn't everybody?
Some guy rowed across the Atlantic Ocean.
Good for him.
Why would he do that?
Did he set a new record?
Yes, I think he did.
Well, I guess that's why he did it.
What's the point?
Now he has the world record!
But someone's going to break it, so what good is it?
Well, he can enjoy it while it lasts.
I don't think he even got paid for it.
Some people do it just to do it.
I want to go on a cruise ship.
That sounds like fun. Where do you want to go?
I want to cruise to Hawaii.
That should be a nice trip. Lots of fun, and lots of food.
I have no idea how much it will cost.
I think it depends on the season and on your cabin.
Well, of course I want to go when the weather is nice.
Yes, you don't want to travel in winter storms.
And I want to get a big cabin with a view.
Are you going to travel alone?
No, my sister and I will travel together.
Well, you should go online and try to find a good deal.
I hate to fly.
Because of all the security?
No, because it hurts my ears.
What do you mean?
Every time we land or take off, my ears hurt so much.
That's just the altitude change, I think.
Whatever it is, it hurts.
Can't you take medicine or something for it?
I've tried everything, but nothing works.
Have you tried earplugs?
They don't work, either.
Well, be glad you're not a pilot.
Spring break starts tomorrow.
Are you going to go anywhere?
I was thinking of driving to Arizona.
To the Grand Canyon?
Yes. I've never been there.
I was there when I was a kid.
How did you like it?
I loved it. I still remember how amazing it was.
I'm sure I'll like it, too.
You should try riding a mule on a trail to the bottom.
No way! I don't want to fall to my death.
Don't worry. Only one person has ever fallen off a mule.
That hotel was terrible.
The worst in the whole world.
The walls were so thin.
All day long we heard TVs or telephones.
All night long we heard people snoring.
Housekeeping didn't give us fresh towels.
Room service brought us a cold dinner.
Our nonsmoking room stunk of cigarette smoke.
Our room was right next to the elevator and the ice machine.
They added phony charges to our bill.
How did we end up in that terrible hotel?
The travel agent gave us a 50-percent discount!
I have to hang up. I'm so sleepy.
It's not even 10 o'clock.
I'm falling asleep on the phone.
You got up real early.
I had to take my friend to the airport.
Why didn't you take a nap when you got home?
I didn't get home until 30 minutes ago.
Why is that?
There was a bomb threat at the airport.
Only a threat?
Yes, but I was stuck there all day while they looked for the bomb.
Someday the bomb is going to be for real.
My dad went to Washington, D.C.
Why did he do that?
He was invited, along with about 90 other veterans.
Who invited them?
Some private organization.
Why did they invite him?
To thank him and all the other soldiers who served in World War II.
That's very nice.
My dad got to see the beautiful new World War II Monument.
That trip must have cost a lot of money.
I saw what you did.
I didn't do anything.
Oh yes, you did.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't have any idea.
You know what you did.
Maybe I know, but how could you know?
Because I was watching you.
Okay, I'm sorry I did it.
Don't drink milk out of the carton. Use a glass!
I promise I'll never drink out of the carton again.
I love salads.
Me too.
I usually eat a simple salad.
What do you put in it?
Just lettuce, tomato, and celery.
That's it?
I add some pepper and salt.
I always put cheese in my salads.
Yes, cheese is nice.
What kind of dressing do you use?
I pour lots of French dressing on top.
Me too. French dressing is so delicious! Who cares about calories?
I love cheese.
Me too.
Where does cheese come from?
It comes from cows.
So we get cheese from cows, and we get milk, too?
Yes, we do.
What else do we get from cows?
We get hamburgers and steak.
Oh, that's so delicious.
We also get leather.
We get a lot of things from cows, don't we?
Yes. A cow is man's best friend.
I used to work in a deli.
How did you like it?
I loved it!
Did you get free food?
I ate free cheese and meat every day.
That sounds like a great job.
Whatever a customer ordered, I sliced off a little more for me.
Did you get fat?
No, but I did put on a few pounds.
That sounds like a dream job.
It was, until one day my manager caught me.
No more free cheese for you, huh?
I'm on a new diet.
What are you eating now?
I switched from pasta to potatoes.
Why did you do that?
Pasta is processed food. Potatoes are natural food.
Natural food has more vitamins.
And it's just as easy to prepare.
How do you prepare the potatoes?
I wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes.
That's pretty simple.
Then I add butter, salt, and pepper.
Can I have all those cans of tomato sauce you bought for your pasta?
My girlfriend's mom got mad at me at the dinner table.
Why was that?
I sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before I tasted it.
What's the matter with that?
Her mom is a great cook.
So, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything.
It hurt her feelings.
Oh.
I apologized to her, but I could tell she was still upset.
Maybe you shouldn't eat there again.
I'm sure everything will be okay in a day or two.
It's your girlfriend's fault. She should have warned you.
I eat the same thing every day.
You're kidding.
No, I'm serious.
Doesn't that get old?
No, because I'm eating food that I like.
But the same thing day after day gets old.
Well, I guess if it ever does get old, I'll change to something different.
Do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?
No, I hate vegetables.
But you eat fruits.
I eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day.
Well, there's nothing wrong with that.
There's something wrong with my orange.
What's wrong?
It's not orange!
Your orange isn't orange?
No, it's dark pink!
Are you sure? I never heard of such a thing.
I just peeled it, and I'm looking at it right now.
Let me see. Yes, you're right. Your orange is pink.
Who ever heard of such a thing?
Oh, look. Here's the little sticker that was on it. It's called a Pink Navel.
What is this world coming to?
Who knows? Maybe soon we'll have pink bananas.
I love peanuts.
Me, too. I love them roasted and salted.
I love boiled peanuts.
Boiled? I never heard of that.
Just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.
I'll have to try them sometime.
They're best when they're hot.
My brother is allergic to peanuts.
That's not good.
No, it isn't. He almost died when he was little.
I guess he has to be very careful about what he eats.
He has a very strict diet.
I'm gaining weight.
How much have you gained?
Three pounds just this month.
Do you know why?
I think it's the ice cream.
You started eating ice cream?
It was on sale.
How much did you buy?
I filled up my freezer with ice cream.
Well, it won't last forever.
No, I figure I'll finish it all by next week.
Then you can start losing weight, if there isn't another sale.
I'm stuffed.
Of course you are. You ate everything on the table.
I don't like to eat leftovers.
I'm glad to hear there's something you don't like to eat.
I like my food hot and fresh.
You like to see it disappear.
I don't like it reheated.
Well, you'll have hot fresh food tomorrow night.
I'm so full I'm going to burst.
You should loosen your belt.
I already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants.
Well, don't stand up, please.
I'm trying to stretch my dollars.
How are you doing that?
I started shopping at the dollar store.
That saves a lot of money.
I bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.
That's a good deal.
Yes, even though some of the potatoes had eyes.
Just put them in the fridge.
Also, I bought a can of cheap coffee and a bag of good coffee.
Why did you do that?
I mixed them together.
If the coffee still tastes okay, that's a good idea.
I like that shirt.
So do I.
How much is it?
I don't know. The tag is missing.
Ask the clerk.
I will.
Oh, look. Here's another shirt just like it.
Does it have a price tag?
Yes, it does. It's only $20.
That's a great price.
I think I'll buy both of them.
You'd better try them on first.
I bought you a pair of pants.
Thank you.
I hope they fit.
I hope you kept the receipt.
You think they won't fit?
I think I've put on some weight.
You think?
Maybe a pound or two.
Maybe four or five pounds?
My waist is bigger than it was.
No problem. These pants have an elastic waistband.
You are so smart!
What do we need to buy?
Let me look at our list.
I know that we need milk.
Nonfat.
Of course. What else?
We need cheese, bread, and ham.
What kind of cheese?
Swiss.
Of course, the cheese with holes in it.
I never used to buy Swiss cheese.
Why not?
I didn't want to pay for the holes.
I need some pants.
I thought you just bought a pair.
I did.
What's wrong with them so soon?
The pants are fine, but the pocket has a huge hole in it.
You shouldn't carry your keys and pens in your pocket.
But that's what pockets are for.
You should carry them in a purse.
I'm a man, and men don't carry purses!
Well, you should buy pants with stronger pockets.
I would if I could find someone who makes strong pockets.
Try a Google search online.
What are those wipes for?
You use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.
That's a great idea.
Yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers.
I'm going to take five wipes.
What do you need five of them for?
One to wipe the handle, and the others to wipe the produce.
What's the matter with the produce?
Do you think the bananas fell from the sky?
What do you mean?
I mean, someone used their dirty hands to pick the bananas, the apples, and the oranges.
Well, you better save a wipe for the dirty dollar bills you're going to pay with.
Did you go to the 99 Cents store?
Yes, I did.
What did you buy?
Well, I got a lot of good deals, as usual.
Like what?
Well, a dozen large eggs were only 99 cents.
That's a good deal.
And a one-pound tub of soft butter was the same price.
Another good deal.
But the best deal was five pounds of potatoes for 99 cents.
I don't know how that store makes money.
Neither do I, but they're doing something right.
I need a new computer.
What's the matter with yours?
It's six years old.
That's pretty old.
It still works, but I'm going to give it to a charity.
Are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?
Oh, a laptop, of course.
A PC or a Mac?
I haven't decided yet.
More and more people are using Macs.
But 90 percent of the world uses PCs.
And that's not going to change anytime soon.
I got ripped off.
What happened?
I had a car problem, so I went online.
Did you find a solution?
Yes, I did. A site I went to said they would send me the solution.
So, what's the problem?
I sent them $20 using my credit card, but they never sent me the solution.
What are you going to do?
I sent them an email asking for my money back.
Have you heard from them?
Not yet. It's been a week.
Well, I guess that's a $20 lesson for you.
Where's the pencil sharpener?
Which one?
Any one. I need to sharpen this pencil.
I think there's one on the dining room table.
I already looked there.
Did you look in the desk drawer?
Yes, I looked there, too.
Don't we have about five sharpeners?
Yes, but they seem to have legs.
Tomorrow I'm going to buy an electric sharpener.
Get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.
Yes. That way it will stay where I put it.
I really like this house.
Can we afford it?
They want 20 percent down.
That's a lot of money.
But the house is so nice.
It's in a great neighborhood.
It's close to the beach.
It's close to the freeways.
It's got a big yard.
The kids love the house, too.
If we don't buy it, someone else will.
You're right. Let's buy it now. We can worry later.
We can't afford this house.
Are you sure?
We will be house rich, but cash poor.
What do you mean?
Our monthly payments will be too high.
We won't have any money for other things?
No, we won't have money for gas or food.
We'll be eating peanut butter sandwiches?
Without the peanut butter!
That's no good!
We have to find a cheaper house.
Of course. We can't live without gas or peanut butter.
That is a beautiful house.
I don't like it.
What's the matter with it?
It's on the corner.
So?
That means it gets twice as much traffic.
You're right.
When you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.
Or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.
Or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.
Let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.
That's perfect. The less traffic, the better.
I hate looking for an apartment.
Me, too.
We have a 2 o'clock appointment to see the one on Main Street.
We'd better get ready to go.
It's an upstairs unit.
That's good, because I don't want to live under people with loud feet.
And it's a corner unit.
That's great. We won't have neighbors on both sides of us.
No pets are allowed.
Perfect. We don't have to listen to barking dogs.
And there are only six units in the whole building.
Where's the checkbook? I'm ready to rent it without even seeing it.
Did you call the manager?
Yes. He said he'd come over tomorrow.
Did he say what time?
Yes. He said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.
Did he understand what the problem is?
Yes. I told him our doorbell doesn't work.
It shouldn't take him long to fix it.
I don't even know why we need to fix it.
In case we have visitors.
But they can just knock on the door.
Actually, I want him to look at our carpet, too.
Yes, it would be nice if he'd give us a new carpet.
Boy, it's chilly outside, isn't it?
It sure is.
In fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too.
Let's turn on the heat.
I'll check to make sure that all the windows are shut.
It should be warmer in a few minutes.
It's so nice to have a heated apartment.
How did they survive in the old days?
They had fireplaces.
Someone had to chop the wood.
And carry it into the house.
All we have to do is flip a switch.
This is a nice neighborhood.
The streets are clean and quiet.
The neighbors don't party on the weekends.
People take care of their lawns.
No rusty old cars are sitting in the front yards.
We never have to call the police about anything.
Our kids are completely safe.
So why are we selling our house?
They're building a 3-story apartment building on the corner.
So we've got to sell before property values go down?
Yes. I still can't believe our city council allowed this building.
They're probably getting something under the table.
That was a huge fire in Santa Barbara.
Yes, it was.
They said about 30 houses burned to the ground.
And they were expensive houses.
I feel so sorry for those people.
Why feel sorry for rich people?
I feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.
So do I, but not if they're rich.
What does that have to do with it?
Rich people think they're better than us.
How many rich people do you know?
None.
Bears are invading our neighborhoods.
Of course they are. They're starving to death.
They should stay in the woods where they belong.
There's no food in the woods.
Can't they eat grass?
Do you think a bear is a cow?
Well, I've seen them eating berries.
Berries aren't in season all year round.
It's too dangerous for kids and pets.
People need to cover their trash cans.
The police need to shoot all the bears.
You don't solve a problem by shooting it.
Do animals talk to each other?
Of course they talk to each other.
What do they talk about?
They talk about other animals.
What else do they talk about?
They talk about food and the weather.
Do they talk about us?
Of course they talk about us.
What do they say about us?
They say that we are funny-looking.
Ha! We're not funny-looking; animals are funny-looking.
We're funny-looking because we wear clothes.
I'm upset with my mom.
Why is that?
I warned her about her new boyfriend. She didn't listen to me.
What happened?
I gave her $1,000 for her birthday. I told her to spend it on herself.
That was very nice of you.
I found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend.
Why did she do that?
He said he would buy her a nice ring.
What's wrong with that?
He went to Las Vegas. He lost it all gambling.
I hope your mom broke up with him.
The ocean is so big.
You can't see the end of it.
It goes on and on forever.
And it's deep, too.
I think it's five miles deep.
Are there fish at the bottom?
There are fish at the top and the bottom.
Are there more fish or more people?
I think there are more fish.
I hope so. I love to eat fish.
We need to save money.
Why do we need to save money?
Because we need to buy a house.
But a house is so expensive.
That's why we need to save money.
How much do we need to save?
We need to save enough for a down payment.
How much is that?
That's about $30,000.
Thirty thousand dollars! That will take forever.
Not if we save every penny.
Okay. Here's seven pennies.
What's for dinner?
I'm not sure.
How about a pizza?
You had pizza for lunch.
But I love pizza.
Everybody loves pizza.
So why can't I have pizza for dinner?
Because you need variety.
What's "variety?
Different things—not the same thing all the time.
You mean, like a pepperoni pizza instead of a cheese pizza?
No, I mean a salad instead of a pizza.
My laptop is so slow.
Buy a new one.
I would if I had the money.
Why is it so slow?
That's a good question.
Did you take it to a computer shop?
I would if I had the money.
Well, I guess you have to live with it.
Sometimes I want to throw it out the window.
You don't want to do that.
Why not?
You might hit someone in the head.
We need a new mattress.
What's the matter with this one?
It's not comfortable.
It seems fine to me.
I toss and turn all night.
You should stop drinking coffee.
Look at these marks on my arms.
What are they?
They are bites.
Did the cat bite you?
No. The bedbugs in that mattress bit me.
Okay. Let's get a new mattress.
I like living here.
I agree. Pasadena is a nice city.
It's not too big.
And it's not too small.
It has great weather all year long.
It has the Rose Parade.
It has beautiful houses.
It has wonderful restaurants.
It has great schools.
It's close to the mountains.
The people are friendly.
I'm not ever going to leave.
I'm bored.
What's on TV?
Nothing.
There must be something on TV!
Nothing that's interesting.
What about that new game show?
Which one?
"Deal or No Deal"
Tell me you're joking.
I love that show.
I watched it once. That was enough.
It's on right now. Let's watch it together.
Are you married?
No. I'm divorced.
When did you get divorced?
I got divorced two years ago.
Why did you get divorced?
My wife left me.
Why did she leave you?
She said she didn't love me anymore.
Wow! That's terrible.
Yes, it was.
Why didn't she love you anymore?
She fell in love with my best friend.
Let's go to the beach.
That's a great idea.
We haven't been in a while.
We haven't been in a month.
The last time we went, you almost drowned.
No, I didn't.
Then why did the lifeguard dive into the water?
I think he wanted to cool off.
He swam right up to you.
And then he turned right around.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we should get going.
Can I borrow $5?
Sure. Why do you need it?
I want to buy lunch.
Where's your money?
It's not in my wallet.
Your wallet is empty?
I don't have even one dollar in it.
Being broke is no fun.
Even if it's only for a short while.
It's always good to have friends.
Friends will lend you money when you're broke.
As long as you pay them back.
Where are you going?
I have to walk the dog.
What kind of dog do you have?
I have a little poodle.
Poodles bark a lot.
They sure do.
They bark at everything.
They never shut up.
Why did you get a poodle?
It's my mom's dog.
So she likes poodles.
She says they're good watchdogs.
Do you have a girlfriend?
No, I don't. Do you?
I don't have a girlfriend, either.
Why not?
I don't know. Maybe I'm not rich enough.
Girls like guys with money.
They sure do.
They like guys with new cars.
I don't have money or a new car.
Me, neither.
But girls like guys who are funny.
Maybe we should learn some good jokes.
Do you have a car?
Yes, I do.
What kind of car do you have?
I have a Honda.
Is it new?
It was new in 2003.
So, it's pretty old now.
Yes, it is. But it still looks good.
Do you take good care of it?
Oh, yes. I wash it once a week.
Do you change the oil?
My mechanic changes the oil twice a year.
Where do you live?
I live in Pasadena.
Where is Pasadena?
It's in California.
Is it in northern California?
No. It's in southern California.
Is Pasadena a big city?
It's pretty big.
How big is "pretty big"?
It has about 140,000 people.
How big is Los Angeles?
It has about 3 million people.
I have to clean the house.
Yes, it's very dirty.
You can help me.
Why me?
Because you helped make it dirty.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to clean the bathroom.
Oh, that's easy.
Clean the sink, the tub, the counter, and the toilet.
That's a lot of work.
Tell me when you finish.
I don't think so. You'll just give me more work.
You're watching too much TV.
What do you mean?
I mean you're wasting your life.
I'm having fun.
You're sitting there with your mouth open.
Who cares?
I care. Do something.
Okay. I did something.
What did you do?
I turned up the volume.
That's not what I meant by "do something."
Will you do something? Leave me alone.
Did you write a letter to grandma?
Yes, I did.
Did you tell her about school?
I told her that school is fun.
Did you put the letter in an envelope?
Yes, and I sealed the envelope.
Did you put a stamp on the envelope?
I couldn't find any stamps.
They're in the kitchen drawer.
Okay. I just put a stamp on the envelope.
Give me the envelope, and I'll mail it for you.
When is grandma going to learn about e-mail?
Why are you yawning?
I'm sleepy.
Why don't you go to bed?
I want to watch this TV show.
Maybe you should record it.
The tape recorder is broken.
Then you should watch the rerun.
Why? I'm watching the original.
But you'll be asleep in about one minute.
I'm just yawning because the commercials are on.
It's Sunday.
So?
You know what that means.
I forgot.
Sunday means we go to church.
Oh, yeah.
Put on a coat and tie.
Why?
To show respect to God and others.
I'm glad Sunday is only once a week.
I hope God didn't hear that.
He'll forgive me.
Did you feed the cat?
I'll do that in a minute.
The cat is meowing. He's hungry.
Okay. I'll feed him right now.
You shouldn't make him wait.
I was doing my homework.
The cat doesn't care about your homework.
The cat doesn't care about anything.
That's the way cats are.
All they think about is themselves.
Maybe we should get rid of him.
Of course not! He's family.
I hate shaving.
Me too.
I just cut myself again.
Did you use a new blade?
It doesn't matter. Old blades cut, new blades cut.
Maybe you should use an electric shaver.
They make a lot of noise, but they don't give a close shave.
Maybe you should stop shaving.
And grow a beard?
Sure. Why not?
Because food and other stuff sticks in my beard.
Hmm. Here's an idea. Put cream on your face and have the cat lick it off.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Are you reading this paper?
Oh, no. Help yourself.
I asked because the paper is sitting next to you.
Thank you. That's polite of you to ask.
Some people would just pick it up.
Yes, I know. Some people are rude.
I always try to be polite.
So do I.
The world needs more polite people like us.
I agree 100 percent.
Mom, I want a puppy.
Let me think about it.
Why do you have to think about it?
Because a puppy costs money.
No, it doesn't. Puppies are free.
Yes, but a puppy needs shots.
Shots for what?
So it won't get sick. Just like you get shots.
I hate shots.
And a puppy eats food. Food costs money.
No problem. I'll give him food off my plate.
Oh, no you don't. Puppies don't eat vegetables.
Let's go to the animal shelter.
What do you want to do?
I want to get a puppy for my son.
That will make him so happy.
I'll get him one of those little dogs.
One that won't grow up too big.
And eat too much.
Do you know which one he would like?
Oh, yes, I took him there yesterday. He showed me one that he really liked.
I bet you had to drag him away.
He wanted to take it home yesterday.
I wonder what he'll name it.
What's the weather like?
I don't know. I just woke up.
Why don't you look outside?
Okay. It looks like rain.
Why do you say that?
The sky is gray.
Is it raining right now?
No.
How do you know?
The street isn't wet.
I have to go shopping today.
You'd better take an umbrella.
I can't believe how hot it is.
It's not even noon yet.
That means it will get hotter.
I am dying from the heat.
Turn on the air conditioner.
It doesn't work.
What happened?
I don't know.
Did you call the repairman?
Of course.
When is he coming?
He's busy. He said next week.
I'll be glad when winter comes.
Why is that?
Because I love the snow.
Yes, the snow is fun.
Last year we made a big snowman.
How big was it?
It was seven feet tall.
How long did it take?
It took us all day.
Did you give him a nose?
Of course. We gave him a big carrot for a nose.
Let me help you make one this year.
I'm going to the bank.
What do you need to do?
I need to withdraw some money.
How are you going to do that?
I'll just use the ATM.
What's that?
It's the Automatic Teller Machine.
It gives you money?
I just insert my debit card into the machine.
And it gives you money?
Well, it gives me money, but it's my own money.
Oh. What good is that? I thought it gave you free money.
Did you put the blue bin out on the street?
Oh, no. I forgot.
Well, you'd better take it out front.
What time does the recycle truck come by?
It usually gets here at noon on Tuesday, which is tomorrow.
I'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning.
Oh, no, you don't.
What do you mean?
Every morning you get up late and rush off to work late.
Do you think I'll forget to do it?
You'll remember to do it, but you won't have time to do it.
Okay, I'll take it out front right now.
Are you ready?
Ready for what?
Ready for the big switch.
What are you talking about?
The nation is switching to digital TV.
Oh. Of course I'm ready.
Did you buy the converter?
No, I don't need a converter because I bought a digital TV.
How much was that?
It was only about $120 for a 13-inch screen.
Does it pick up any digital channels?
Oh, yes. I get six Korean channels but nothing in English!
People are funny.
They sure are.
Did you hear about the pilot?
The one that stole a small plane?
Yes, he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U.S.
Did they catch him?
Yes. After two U.S. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway.
Did he crash?
No, he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant.
Did the cops find out why he flew into the U.S.?
His life sucked. He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.
Poor guy.
The police need our help finding a robber.
How do you know?
The TV news is reporting a bank robbery.
Do they know what the robber looks like?
Yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old.
What race is he?
They didn't say.
The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore.
Of course not. That would be racist.
But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?
Don't ask me.
Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist.
Don't wipe your nose on your sleeve.
But I don't have a tissue.
Then go find a tissue in the bathroom.
I didn't have time to get one from there.
Your sleeves are not tissues.
But Mom, all my friends use their sleeves.
That doesn't make it right.
I saw Dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.
I will talk to your father about that.
I bet Dad did it all the time when he was my age.
Your daddy was a good little boy.
How do you know? Were you his mommy, too?
I'm worried.
Worried about what?
I'm getting married.
You should be happy, not worried.
I am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.
Yes, you have to take care of your wife.
And I have to take care of our children.
Are you going to start a family?
Yes. We want to have a little boy and a little girl.
That sounds wonderful.
Except we can't afford it!
No wonder you're worried.
I don't get art.
Or artists.
They're in a different world.
I saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.
The artist said the jar was both full and empty.
But it was full of pencils! How could he say it was empty?
Artists see things differently.
Did you ever see anything that Picasso painted?
Of course! He's world famous.
Did he ever take art lessons?
I can't believe it. I drew paintings like that in third grade.
Where are they? Maybe they are worth millions.
What's the point?
The point of what?
Of living.
Who knows? You live, and then you die.
We must be here for some reason.
Maybe we're here to have fun.
Then why aren't I having fun?
Because you're thinking too much.
So I should stop thinking?
Stop thinking about what the point is.
Okay. I'll start thinking about having some fun.
Just be patient. Fun doesn't come along every five minutes.
Beer is a powerful drug.
So are cigarettes.
Which would you prefer?
What do you mean?
When you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes.
I could pick only one or the other?
Yes. Nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.
Boy, that's a tough one.
What's so tough about it? Of course, I would pick cigarettes.
But cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.
Well, you can't have everything.
I don't think I want to go to your heaven.
My pants have a hole in the front pocket.
You shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.
Yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.
Lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.
Who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?
Criminals, of course.
Anyway, I have to fix the hole.
You can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.
Tell me about this patch.
The patch has glue. The hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
That sounds a lot easier than sewing.
It is. But after about ten washings, the glue washes off.
Do you know any good jokes?
I can't remember jokes.
Neither can I.
They go in one ear and out the other.
Who makes up all these jokes?
Who knows? But there must be a hundred new ones every day.
Yes, just in English alone.
I wonder if every language has jokes.
Of course! People everywhere like good jokes.
What do you think people joke about the most?
I think most jokes are about women.
Oh, really? I think most jokes are about men!
You're very lucky.
Why do you say that?
You speak two languages.
Well, my English isn't perfect.
No one speaks perfect English.
Maybe I will be the first!
I've been thinking about learning Spanish.
Spanish is easy. I'll be happy to teach you.
How long will it take me to learn?
I think it will only take you a year or two.
How soon can we begin?
Ahora! That means right now.
Do you know what today is?
Yes, it's April 22.
It's more than just a date.
Is it your birthday or anniversary?
No, it's Earth Day.
What's that?
It's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.
Oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?
Yes. We need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags.
How about if I take shorter showers?
That's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water.
From now on I'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower.
Poetry sucks.
I don't know anyone who likes it.
Some of it is okay, I guess.
Yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.
Like "One, two, buckle my shoe."
But people still write poems.
No one makes any money at it.
Shakespeare was a poet.
Did he get rich from his poetry?
Probably not.
Poems are a little bit like songs.
Yes, but songs have music. Without music, songs would suck, too.
How smart are you?
I don't know. I think I'm average.
Did you ever take an IQ test?
No, I never did. All I know is that I got A's and B's in school.
I wish I was really smart.
Don't be ridiculous.
What do you mean?
If you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.
Don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super-smart?
It must be very lonely.
Why's that?
Because if you're super-smart, no one understands what you're saying.
I missed the TV news last night. What was on?
Nothing that would pass as news.
What's the weather going to be like this weekend?
I don't know. Whenever the weather comes on, I switch channels.
What was the lead story on the news?
Some actress was in court for driving without a license.
What was the second story?
Some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter.
What was the third story?
A bull chased a man in a supermarket.
Wasn't there anything about Octo-Mom?
Of course. She's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants.
What are you going to do about your death?
Well, mostly I'll try to avoid it.
I mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?
My wife and I will be cremated.
Are you going to be buried next to each other?
Oh, no. Our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.
You're not going to be buried?
A coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.
Yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.
Children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.
That's true. A cemetery is for dead people, not living people.
We figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach.
Did you wipe your feet?
Yes, of course I wiped my feet.
Then why is there mud on the carpet?
I don't know. It's not my mud.
Well, someone brought it into the house.
Look at the bottom of my shoes—they're clean.
Of course they're clean. You left all the mud on the carpet.
Okay, I'll get the vacuum cleaner.
Don't vacuum it now.
Don't you want me to clean up the mud?
Wait till it dries. It will be easier to vacuum.
Next time I will be more careful.
What are you getting for your mom?
What are you talking about?
Sunday is Mother's Day.
This Sunday?
Of course. It's all over the news.
I thought it was next Sunday.
Well, you'd better get her something.
I'll get her a nice card.
Is that it?
Yes. That's all I ever give her.
She raised you, and all you ever give her is a card?
It's okay. She knows that I love her.
I don't like our flag.
What's the matter with it?
It's too much like other flags.
Yes, a lot of flags have stripes.
A flag should be pretty.
What should our flag look like?
It should have a pretty woman on it.
That's ridiculous!
You don't like pretty women?
Of course I do. But not on our flag!
Every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
You can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it!
I don't like our flag.
What's the matter with it?
It's too much like other flags.
Yes, a lot of flags have stripes.
A flag should be pretty.
What should our flag look like?
It should have a pretty woman on it.
That's ridiculous!
You don't like pretty women?
Of course I do. But not on our flag!
Every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
You can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it!
I had a busy morning.
What did you do?
I watered all the plants.
You have a lot of plants.
Then I did my laundry.
That takes some time.
I took the dog for a walk.
I'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
I vacuumed the entire house.
That's a lot of work.
And then I made lunch.
I'll bet you were hungry!
I don't have long distance service with my home phone.
So how do you make long distance calls?
I use a calling card.
Where do you get that?
I buy it at the dollar store.
How much is it?
It's one dollar for 100 minutes.
That's only a penny a minute!
It's a great price. But you have to dial a lot of numbers.
How many?
First you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers.
Yikes. I think I'll keep my long distance service.
Do you go to college?
Yes, I do.
What college do you go to?
I go to Pasadena City College.
Do you like it?
Oh, yes, I really like it.
Why do you like it?
Because it has great teachers.
What else?
I like all my classmates, too.
Anything else?
Yes. It's not expensive!
I lost my new pen.
Where did you lose it?
I don't know.
When did you lose it?
I think I lost it today. I used it yesterday.
Did you check all your pockets?
I checked all my pockets.
Did you look in your desk?
Yes. It isn't there, either.
It's probably around somewhere.
Oh, well, it only cost me a dollar.
Only a dollar? Don't even look for it.
Gravity is very important.
What is gravity?
It's the force that pulls everything down.
I don't understand.
If you pour water into a glass, the water goes down into the glass.
Of course it does.
Without gravity, the water would go up.
You're joking.
Without gravity, you would go up.
What do you mean?
You would float into the sky like a balloon.
That would be fun!
I can't read my book.
Turn on the light.
The light is on.
Open the book.
The book is open.
See an eye doctor.
That's what I need to do.
He'll give you a prescription for glasses.
I'll make an appointment tomorrow.
I'll get the yellow pages for an eye doctor.
Read the phone number to me.
I'll read it very loud, in case your hearing is getting bad, too.
What do you need for school?
I need pencils.
Anything else?
I need a notebook.
Do you need a pen?
No. I already have a pen.
Do you need a calculator?
No. The teacher doesn't permit calculators.
How about a dictionary?
No, we have a big dictionary in the classroom.
Well, I guess that's it.
Yes, that's all I need for now.
I like this magazine.
So do I.
I read it once, and I subscribed.
It gives you all the news.
All the news in only 50 pages.
I like the political cartoons.
I like the beautiful photos of the houses for sale.
I always read the film reviews.
I never miss the food and drink section.
I gave a subscription to my parents.
Me too. They canceled their other news magazines.
So did mine!
My pen is out of ink.
Shake it a couple of times.
I shook it. There is no more ink.
You can borrow mine.
Thank you. I'll buy a new one tomorrow.
What were you doing?
I was writing a letter.
Who were you writing to?
It's to my mom.
Tell her I said hello.
Okay. I'll return your pen when I'm done.
Take your time.
Have you done your homework?
Not yet.
Then why are you watching TV?
This is my favorite show.
Go do your homework.
But, mom!
You can watch TV after you do your homework.
But the show will be over.
There will be another show next week.
Please?
You know the rules.
I hate the rules! I can't wait till I grow up.
I can't wait until I graduate.
Me too.
No more homework.
I hate homework.
Are you going to college?
I can't afford it.
Me neither.
So what are you going to do?
I'm joining the army.
You're kidding. You might get killed.
I don't think so. After I finish, I'll have enough money to go to college.
That's not a bad idea.
What is your major?
English.
What are you going to do with an English major?
I'm going to be a teacher.
High school or middle school?
High school.
I teach high school English.
I didn't know that.
I started teaching five years ago.
How do you like it?
Do you see all this gray hair? It was totally black five years ago.
Maybe I'll teach middle school.
Parking at school is impossible.
I'll say.
I drove around for half an hour.
Did you find a spot?
I found a spot, but someone cut in and took it from me.
Did you yell at them?
Yes, I did.
And?
And he yelled back at me.
How rude.
But I got lucky a few minutes later.
You have to be lucky to find a parking space.
Did you see "Titanic"?
Yes. It is a great movie.
I saw it twelve times.
I saw it eight times.
I have the DVD.
So do I.
Let's go to your home.
We can watch my DVD.
And then we can go to my home.
And watch your DVD.
I always cry at the end.
Me too. It's so sad.
Let's play cards.
I don't know any card games.
I'll teach you one.
Okay. What will you teach me?
It's called poker.
Is it easy to learn?
Yes, it will only take about 30 minutes.
Okay. Teach me how to play.
We each get five cards.
Oh, look. I have four tens.
That's great, but you're not supposed to tell me.
Oh. Sorry. Okay, I don't have four tens.
I'm a good card player.
Why is that?
Because I watch the other players.
What do you mean?
People will tell you if they have a good hand.
How do they do that?
For example, a friend of mine licks his lips.
When he licks his lips, you know he has a good hand?
I know he has a good hand, so I don't bet.
He never wins your money?
Nope, and it drives him crazy.
He knows you can't read his mind. Maybe he thinks you're cheating.
Turn the radio down, please.
But I'm listening to it.
Well, listen to it more quietly.
I can't wait till I grow up.
What will you do?
I will play the radio as loud as I want.
That's okay with me.
I will have a radio in every room of my house.
Remind me to never visit you.
All the radios will be on extra loud.
Your neighbors will hate you.
If they don't like it, they can move.
I hope I win the lotto.
Your chances are very small.
But you can't win if you don't play.
Ha! You can't win if you do play.
Someone has to win.
That's what everyone says.
It might as well be me.
That's what everyone says.
You're trying to tell me something.
That didn't take long.
You think I should quit playing.
Save your money for school.
What's on TV?
Nothing much.
What about the baseball game?
It got rained out.
Rained out?
Yes, rained out.
How could that be?
Well, you can't play baseball in a rainstorm.
I thought they were playing under a dome.
The dome doesn't close.
Why doesn't it close?
Who knows? They said they'll fix it before next season.
Can I try your coffee?
Sure. Here you go.
Hmm, that's not bad.
There's nothing in it.
What do you mean?
I mean, it's just coffee.
I figured that.
It's not too bitter for you?
It's a little bitter, but it's okay.
There's no sugar or cream in it.
No, it's a taste you have to get used to.
Sort of like beer.
That woman is a very good singer.
Yes, but she looks like a man.
What difference does it make?
Female singers are supposed to be pretty.
Singers are supposed to sound good.
They should look good, too.
There are lots of ugly men singers.
Men singers don't have to look good.
Then neither do women singers.
Well, I would never buy her CD.
But you would buy her CD if she was pretty?
Yes. I would buy all of her CDs.
Do you get PBS on TV?
Yes, everybody gets the Public Broadcasting System.
It puts me to sleep.
Tell me about it.
A gardening show follows a knitting show.
A cooking show follows a sewing show.
A travel show follows another travel show.
I'll say! I've gone around the world a dozen times already!
Now they're adding old TV shows to the old movies.
I sure would like to see something interesting for a change.
If more people donate money, PBS could offer new shows.
Who wants to donate? Public TV should be free.
Old movies are the best.
Even though they're in black and white.
A good story is more important than color.
Actors didn't curse back then.
And there was no violence.
People today don't like that.
No, today people like lots of action.
I like a good story.
I like to see actors who are like real people.
Like real people with real problems.
They still make movies like that.
Yes, but they never make much money.
They call him Father Dollar Bill.
Yes, he was on the TV news today.
Every Easter Sunday he gives away money.
Is it his money?
No. Movie stars give him money to give to homeless people.
How much money does he give away?
This year he gave away $15,000.
That's a lot of money.
He gave $100 to people in wheelchairs.
What about the other homeless people?
They got $1 each.
People stood in line just to get one dollar?!
What's your favorite thing to do?
I like to watch people.
That's your favorite thing to do?
Well, it's one of them.
Where do you go to watch people?
My girlfriend and I sit outside Starbucks.
That sounds like a good spot.
We watch people walk by with their dogs.
I guess you see lots of different dogs.
We don't even know what kind most of them are.
There are lots of different kinds, but they all have one thing in common.
Yes, they love to sniff each other when they meet.
The Beatles are the best.
They are the best musical group ever.
I love all their songs.
I don't know which one I like the best.
I like the ones I can sing along with.
So do I, like "She Loves You."
"She loves you, Yeah, yeah, yeah!..."
"…And you know you should be glad!"
What a great song.
How about "Let It Be?"
Oh, yes! "Let it be, let it be…"
"…There will be an answer, let it be!"
TV news is so stupid.
They shouldn't even call it news.
Last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.
Yesterday they told us about a dog in a pipe.
Last week they told us about a bear in a back yard.
Last month they told us about a mouse in a restaurant.
The weatherman tells us the temperature in every town.
The sports guy shows us players fighting.
They always tell us "what's next."
They always make "what's next" sound exciting, but it never is.
It's more like news for kids.
They should have kid reporters.
Look at the car chase on TV!
That driver is crazy.
I can't believe he hasn't crashed.
How fast is he going?
They say he's going 80 miles per hour.
He's going to kill someone.
Look! He just hit that car.
Oh, my goodness. No one is safe on the streets.
Now he's slowing down.
Maybe he ran out of gas.
Look! He just got out of the car and started running.
I hope the police catch him.
I've got a date for you.
Oh, really?
Are you interested?
Maybe. What is she like?
She's got a great personality.
Uh-oh. That means that she's fat and ugly.
She's cute.
Okay, so she's not ugly; she's just fat.
She weighs 98 pounds.
Okay, she's not fat. So what's the problem with her?
Who said there is a problem with her?
The problem is she has no problems—she's too good for me!
I think you're very pretty.
Thank you.
Would you have dinner with me?
I would like to.
Can I pick you up Friday night?
What time?
Eight o'clock.
That sounds great.
We'll go to a French restaurant.
I've never been to a French restaurant.
I think you'll love the food.
I'm not going to eat any snails!
You have pretty eyes.
Thank you. So do you.
I wish my eyes were blue.
What's the matter with green eyes?
Nothing, except my favorite color is blue.
Maybe in your next life you'll have blue eyes.
But what if I'm a fish in my next life?
I think some fish have blue eyes.
I'm in love with that girl.
Have you told her?
Of course not.
Why not?
She would laugh at me.
How do you know?
Because they always do.
Maybe she's different.
They're all the same.
Just ask her out to dinner.
And then what?
And then she'll know that you like her.
Give me a hug.
I'm not in the mood.
What's the matter?
I saw you looking at that woman.
What woman?
You know, that woman with the big boobs.
I was not looking at her.
You were, too.
I'm not interested in her.
Then why were you looking at her?
I was looking at something else.
Oh, really? Then spend tonight looking at the sofa.
Would you like to go on a blind date?
You must be joking.
No, I'm serious.
I don't want to date a blind woman.
A blind date doesn't mean that she is blind!
What does it mean?
A blind date is a date with someone you don't know.
Why would I date someone I don't even know?
To try something new and exciting.
What if I don't like her?
I have a date tomorrow night.
Really? Who with?
A girl I met at the market.
You met a girl at the supermarket?
She was standing behind me in a really slow line at the checkout counter.
What did you say to her?
I had two pineapples in my cart, and she asked where I had found them.
She asked you about your pineapples?
I told her I had gotten the last two on the shelf, but I offered her one of mine.
That was nice of you.
She asked me how she could return the favor, so I asked her out.
Sometimes a slow line can be a good thing.
Did you have a date Friday night?
Yes, in fact, I did.
Who did you go out with?
A man I met in a coffee shop.
Where did you go?
We went to a nice restaurant.
Anywhere else?
Then we went to a jazz club.
That sounds like a nice date.
Yes, it was pleasant.
But you won't date him again?
No. He was nice, but there was no chemistry.
I had the worst date the other night.
What happened?
First of all, he was half an hour late.
That's not a good start.
Then he didn't bother to apologize.
That's rude.
Then he drove too fast to the restaurant.
That's dangerous.
I thought about getting out and taking a taxi home.
What happened at the restaurant?
We had a $40 meal, and he left a $1 tip!
I guess you can't go back to that restaurant.
I don't like that man.
Why not?
He's a dirty old man.
What do you mean?
He's old enough to be my father, yet he asked me out.
Well, you can't blame a man for asking.
He should act his age.
But a lot of old people are still interested in dating.
They should find a nice hobby.
Just wait until you're 50 years old.
Dating will be the furthest thing from my mind.
That's what you say now. Wait till you're 50.
Does your girlfriend ever make you angry?
Sometimes.
What does she do?
Just yesterday, I told her I wouldn't trade her for all the money in the world.
That was a nice thing to say.
That's what I thought.
What did she say?
She laughed! She didn't believe me.
That wasn't very nice of her.
She said that nothing is more important to me than money.
What did you say?
I told her I wouldn't trade her for any other woman in the world.
Some people have good noses.
I wish I had a good nose. Mine is way too big.
I don't mean good-looking. I mean good-smelling.
Oh. But that can be a curse.
Yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.
I'll say. My girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.
Did she catch you using drugs?
Sort of. She knows whenever I sneak a cigarette.
You don't need a good nose for that—cigarettes stink.
But when I sneak just one cigarette in the morning, she can smell it that evening!
Boy, that is a good nose.
I told her she should apply for a job at customs.
I don't like riding the bus.
Why not?
The seats and windows are dirty.
Don't they clean the bus every night?
I think they do.
You should bring some wipes with you.
That's a good idea.
Then you can wipe your seat and window.
People will think I'm strange.
Who cares? Everyone is strange.
That's for sure.
Don't worry about what people think.
I don't like riding the bus.
Why not?
Number one, it's too slow.
You're right. A car is faster.
Number two, it's usually late.
You're right. The buses are never on time.
Number three, it doesn't run 24 hours.
You're right. Buses don't run late at night.
Number four, it's too crowded.
You're right. You have to stand in the aisle.
Number five, it's unsafe.
You're right. Bad guys might rob you.
We had a problem at school.
What was the problem?
Someone cut the tires.
What tires?
The tires on the cars.
Where were the cars?
They were in the student parking lot.
How many tires were cut?
One or two tires were cut on each car.
How many cars?
Eleven cars.
That's terrible. I hope they catch the person.
Life isn't fair.
It sure isn't.
I got a ticket yesterday.
What for?
I was crossing the street.
Were you in a crosswalk?
Yes, but the red hand was blinking.
So? That's a ticket?
Yes, it's a $140 ticket.
That's not right!
When I started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking.
You need to walk faster.
You're driving too fast.
Why do you say that?
The speed limit is 65.
I know that.
But you're doing 75.
So is everyone else.
But a cop might stop you.
No, he won't. Some cars are doing 85.
So the cop will stop those cars?
Of course. He stops the fastest cars.
My friend got a ticket for doing 75.
Your friend was unlucky.
Remember to put air in your tires.
How often do I have to do that?
Once every two months.
That's a lot.
What do you mean?
That's six times a year!
Yes, and it takes about five minutes each time.
I'll try.
Check your tires or you'll get a flat.
Oh. That's not good.
No, it isn't. A flat costs you time and money.
And I don't have either.
You're driving too fast.
I'm in a hurry.
Don't ever be in a hurry.
It's not my fault. You didn't wake me up.
That's not my fault. You didn't tell me to wake you up.
Well, I meant to.
Don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving.
Why not?
Because you'll have an accident. Most accidents are because people are in a hurry.
How do you know that?
I read a lot.
I thought drunks caused most accidents.
Let's go for a ride.
Where are we going?
Into the mountains.
That sounds nice.
I want to show you my new car.
You bought a new car?
Yes. I bought a Cadillac.
A luxury car.
Luxury plus speed.
What are we waiting for?
Let me get the keys.
Let me get my camera.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Why didn't you go before we left?
I did, but I have to go again.
Well, hold on a little longer.
I think I'm going to explode.
Just hold on.
Oh! Don't hit any more bumps!
We'll be at McDonald's in just a few minutes.
I hope they are fast minutes.
Think about something else. Think about a hamburger.
I'm thinking, but I still have to go.
It's the next exit. Hold on!
Where's the car?
What do you mean?
The car isn't here.
Where did you park it?
I parked it right here.
Are you sure?
Yes. I remember this big tree.
Maybe it's the wrong tree.
No, this is the tree.
Did someone steal it?
I sure hope not.
Maybe they towed it away.
Look at this traffic.
I'd rather not.
It gets worse every year.
Why are you complaining? We're going almost 20 miles an hour.
The speed limit is 65!
Well, that's between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.
Where are all these people going?
They're all asking the same question.
When are they going to fix this problem?
They said they need more money.
They always need more money.
It'll get worse before it gets better.
My car is dirty.
Why don't you wash it?
That's what I'm going to do.
Are you going to wash it yourself?
Of course. It's not a hard job.
I'll help you.
Okay, I'll get a bucket.
I'll rinse the car first.
Then we can scrub it with a wet sponge and soap.
After that, we can dry it with a towel.
Then it will look like new
And you save $10.
It sure is windy today.
Paper is flying everywhere.
This wind is dangerous for drivers.
Especially for drivers of big trucks.
The wind blows those trucks over.
It blows trees over, too.
A tree fell onto my dad's car.
Was there much damage?
My dad had to buy a new car.
Wow! That's terrible.
Never park your car under a tree.
The wind will get you, or the birds will get you.
When are we going to stop?
We'll stop at the next McDonald's.
How far away is that?
I think we'll be there in half an hour.
I hope so. I have to go to the bathroom.
Well, I can always pull over.
No, thank you, I'll just wait.
We can kill two birds with one stone.
What do you mean?
While you're using the bathroom, I'll order some food.
Don't order for me. I'm not hungry.
I'm very hungry. I'll order for you, and then I'll eat yours.
This is such a long light.
Look how many cars are waiting in line.
They need a left-turn arrow.
Only two cars can make a left turn every three or four minutes.
We'll be here forever.
Get out of this lane.
But we need to turn left.
Forget it. Go straight.
Then what?
Then we'll just make a U-turn.
And then we can turn right at the light.
Good idea. It will be so much quicker.
I need a cheap car.
How much money do you have?
$1,000.
Well, that should get you something.
But I need something that's reliable.
You need a car with low mileage.
A car that was owned by a little old lady.
Where have you looked?
I haven't looked anywhere yet.
Why not?
Because I'll never find one for such a low price.
You're right about that. Keep saving your money.
Good afternoon, officer.
Your driver's license and registration, please.
Here you go.
Do you know why I pulled you over?
I have no idea. All of a sudden I heard your siren.
You rolled through that stop sign back there.
But I stopped!
No, you didn't. You slowed down, but you didn't come to a full stop.
Well, nobody else does, so why should I?
That's not the attitude of a good driver.
But I am a good driver. I've never had a ticket in my life.
Well, you've got one now. Here. Have a nice day.
$140. I can't believe it.
What are you talking about?
I got a ticket downtown for $140.
Were you speeding?
No, I was crossing the street.
Were you jaywalking?
No, I was in the crosswalk.
So why did you get a ticket?
The officer said the red hand was blinking.
Was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk?
No, the white WALK sign was blinking.
You should fight that ticket. I'll be your witness.
They were in a crosswalk near school at 3 a.m.
Who?
Two students from USC.
What happened?
A speeding car ran a red light, killing the girl.
What happened to the other student?
He landed on the hood of the car.
Did he get off the hood?
No, the car stopped and the passenger pushed the injured student off the hood.
I'll bet the car continued on its way.
Of course it did. Why stop after you've run over two people?
I hope they find them and put them in jail for life.
Did you hear about the ball player?
The home run hitter on drugs?
He said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.
He said he wasn’t using drugs.
He apologized to the fans.
The league suspended him for 50 games.
That will cost him some money.
Yes, about $7 million.
That will teach him a good lesson.
He probably won’t use drugs anymore.
But it won’t stop other players from using drugs.
No. Everyone always figures that they won’t get caught.
Can we go to the baseball game?
Of course.
I love baseball.
So do I.
I love to eat the peanuts.
I love to eat the hot dogs.
I hope we’ll see a home run.
I hope we’ll catch a foul ball.
Bring a jacket.
Yes. It gets a little cool at night.
Bring a glove to catch a foul ball.
No. I’ll just use my cap to catch a foul ball.
Golf is a silly game.
It certainly is.
You hit a white ball.
And then you chase it.
And then you hit it again.
Finally, you put the ball into a hole in the ground.
You do this 18 times, because there are 18 holes.
What’s the point?
How can it be fun?
They pay money to play this silly game!
I think golfers have a mental problem.
I think they’re nuts.
Do you want to go fishing?
Yes. That’s a good idea.
Where do you want to go?
We can go to the river.
Or we can go to the lake.
Or we can go to the ocean.
Let’s go to the lake.
Yes. The lake is only 10 miles away.
We can be there in 20 minutes.
I’ll get our fishing rods.
I’ll get the bait.
We’ll have fresh fish for dinner!
Baseball is fun.
I like to hit the ball.
I like to run around the bases.
I like to slide into the bases.
Yeah. It’s a lot of fun to slide.
I want to be a baseball player when I grow up.
Me too. I want to play for the Yankees.
Not me. I want to play for the Dodgers.
We have to practice every day.
I don’t like practice.
Me neither. It’s boring.
But practice makes perfect.
Baseball is fun.
I like to hit the ball.
I like to run around the bases.
I like to slide into the bases.
Yeah. It’s a lot of fun to slide.
I want to be a baseball player when I grow up.
Me too. I want to play for the Yankees.
Not me. I want to play for the Dodgers.
We have to practice every day.
I don’t like practice.
Me neither. It’s boring.
But practice makes perfect.
Let’s go jogging.
That’s a good idea.
I bought some new shoes.
Are they comfortable?
They’re very comfortable.
How much were they?
They were on sale for $80.
Do they help you run faster?
No, but my feet don’t hurt anymore.
Then they’re worth every penny.
You might want to buy a pair.
I’ll wait until I wear this pair out.
Tiger is the greatest golfer in the world.
You can say that again.
But I’m worried about Tiger.
Why is that?
Because he likes to SCUBA dive.
What’s wrong with that?
It can be dangerous.
You mean he could drown.
He shouldn’t SCUBA dive until he retires.
But he dives to relax.
He might relax, but it makes me nervous.
If his wife doesn’t mind, you shouldn’t mind.
Did you watch that golf tournament?
The one that Tiger won?
How did he do it?
It was nothing for him.
He sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!
He sank a 25-footer last year at the same tournament to win by one stroke.
I think he is from outer space.
No human could possibly play golf that well.
Whenever he needs a shot to win a tournament, he makes that shot.
No human can do that.
Somebody should check his birth record.
I bet it says he was born on Mars.
Who’s the greatest baseball player?
There are so many great players.
Yes, but who is the greatest?
I’d have to say Babe Ruth.
Most people would say that.
He changed the game.
Yes, he made the home run popular.
Everybody loved him, all over the nation.
He helped make the Yankees the best team ever.
And Ruth was a good person, too.
He always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.
There will never be another Babe.
Did you hear what happened at the baseball game?
No, please tell me.
Someone punched out someone.
That’s not nice.
It’s worse than that.
How so?
Two guys got into an argument.
I’ll bet they were drinking.
A third guy punched one of the two guys.
I’ll bet he was drinking, too.
The victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.
That’s terrible. Can’t people just have fun at a baseball game?
I want to go to the ball game.
Is there a game tonight?
Yes, it starts at 7 p.m.
Can we get tickets?
Yes, but only the cheap tickets.
How much are they?
They’re only $5 each.
That’s a good price.
Yes, it’s cheaper than a hot dog or a beer.
Where are the seats?
They’re behind the outfield.
Maybe we can catch a home run ball.
Golf is so hard.
What's so hard about hitting a little white ball?
It's hard if you want to do it right.
You mean like Tiger?
No, like a good amateur golfer.
What's so hard about golf?
There are so many things you have to do right.
Like what?
Like keep your left arm straight, keep your head down, and follow through.
Yikes! Who can remember all that?
You need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.
Forget it. Golf sounds more like work than fun.
I don't believe the art world.
What is it this time?
An Andy Warhol drawing.
He's a famous artist.
He drew two butterflies and a flower on a napkin in a restaurant.
Did he sign it?
Yes.
Is it beautiful?
It's just black ink on a white napkin. And the napkin has food stains!
So it's not worth much?
Only about $30,000.
Without the food stains, it would probably be worth more.
Let's go out to eat.
That sounds like fun.
Where do you want to go?
Let me think a minute.
I feel like Chinese.
That sounds delicious.
I know a good Chinese restaurant.
How far away is it?
It's only 10 minutes from here.
Do we need reservations?
Oh, no. We can walk right in.
Let's go now. I'm hungry!
I can't believe how long this line is.
This is a popular restaurant, isn't it?
Yes, but it isn't a fast-food restaurant, is it?
It's the slowest hamburger in town.
That's because they cook it while you wait.
Yes. That's why it's also the best hamburger in town.
A great burger and great service.
Yes, the workers are very polite.
And they're clean.
I've been coming here for years.
Me too.
Excuse me. They just called my number.
Lunch was delicious.
Thank you.
What kind of soup was that?
It was tomato soup.
That tasted so good.
I put lemon and butter in it.
The sandwich was good, too.
Everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches.
Especially on toast.
And the pickles were great, too.
Tomorrow we'll have rice and fish for lunch.
I can't wait.
I'm calling the waiter.
What's the matter?
This steak has too much fat.
What do you want the waiter to do?
Bring me a better steak.
I wouldn't do that.
Why not?
They will drop the new steak on the floor, step on it, and then spit on it.
You're crazy.
Then the waiter will give you a big smile as he brings you the new steak.
Where do you get these crazy ideas?
I used to cook in a restaurant!
Let's leave.
But we just got here.
Did you see the waiter's hands?
No.
He had dirty fingernails.
Really?
His nails were black!
That's disgusting.
And he poured water into our glasses.
Yuck! No water for me.
I wonder if the cooks' nails are dirty, too.
Who cares? Let's get out of here.
This hot bread is delicious.
I like this restaurant because they give you free bread.
Well, I think we are paying for it.
No. Look at the bill when we get it. There's no charge for the bread.
It is delicious, especially with butter.
I think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.
They probably wouldn't like that.
I'm eating so much bread that I'm getting full.
Then stop eating the bread!
Okay, just one more piece. Pass the butter, please.
If I owned a restaurant, I would never serve hot bread before the main course.
That's terrible. I would never go to your restaurant.
Is this a clean restaurant?
Well, the tables and chairs look okay.
Okay, let's sit down.
Check out the silverware.
It passes inspection.
Here comes the waiter. See if his hands and nails are clean.
Well, the waiter looked clean, so I guess it's okay to eat here.
You're forgetting about the bathroom.
I'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.
You're not going to examine it before we order dinner?
No, I'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because I'm pretty hungry right now.
Me, too. Let's forget about germs and focus on food.Is this a clean restaurant?

Have you seen our waiter?
Here he comes now.
We've been sitting here for almost 10 minutes.
Oops, I guess I was wrong. That isn't our waiter.
We can give him five more minutes, and then leave.
I'll go up front and talk to the manager.
That's a good idea.
Maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.
Maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.
Every time we eat out, it's an adventure.
Last time, we got seats next to the kitchen.
We'll never go there again.

Is this table okay?
No, it's too close to the kitchen door.
How about this table?
No, it's too close to the front door.
This looks like a nice table.
No, it's too close to the salad bar.
Okay, I give up.
Well, there is one good table.
Great. Which one?
That one. A group of eight just sat down at it.
Why is there so much crime?
Because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.
Is that it?
Also, there aren't enough police.
But there are a lot of police.
There's only one police officer per 100 criminals.
Can't we hire more police?
No. It costs too much money.
Doesn't crime cost more than police?
Yes, it does.
So it would be cheaper to hire more police?
Yes, it would.
This is a great neighborhood.
Yes, it is.
People are friendly.
Yes, they are.
The streets and sidewalks are clean.
Yes, they are.
There's a real nice park nearby.
Yes, there is.
I feel safe here.
There is no crime here.
I wish I could move here.
Maybe you can, if someone moves out.
The house burned down.
What happened?
The man fell asleep.
Was he smoking?
Yes, he was smoking a cigarette.
Did he die?
Yes, he did. His cat died, too.
That's too bad. What about his smoke alarm?
The battery was dead.
A good battery would have saved his life.
He had cigarettes, but no battery.
It happens all the time.
They say he has started fifteen big fires.
He's been in jail three times already.
Why did they ever let him out?
It's the law. They can't keep him in jail forever.
Why not? Everyone knows he's a firebug. He loves to start fires.
I don't know. Sometimes the law doesn't make sense.
But his latest fire killed someone.
This time they have charged him with murder.
So maybe he'll go to jail forever?
I sure hope so.
Someone should set him on fire.
That would teach him a good lesson.
Put your seatbelt on.
Why?
Because it will protect you in case of an accident.
But it's uncomfortable.
It's the law.
It's so much trouble.
It's common sense.
It's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.
Hold your breath till we get there.
Okay, my seatbelt is on.
I'm glad you don't complain very much.
I'm ready for an accident.
What are you doing?
I'm going to change the light bulb. It burnt out.
What are you standing on?
A couple of dictionaries and some textbooks.
Are you crazy?
What's the matter?
Those books will slip and you'll fall.
It's only a couple of feet.
What if you fall while you're holding the light bulb, and it breaks and pieces go into your eyes?
I never thought about that.
You'd be blind for the rest of your life!
I'll get the stepladder.
Did you see that puddle of water on the floor?
Yes. I called for a clean-up.
A puddle of water is very dangerous.
It isn't easy to see.
But it's real easy to slip on.
Especially on these slick floors.
Someone who slips could hurt their back.
They could even crack their head open.
We should stand here till the clean-up person gets here.
We can leave if we put an orange cone here.
Yes, but I don't know where the orange cones are.
It doesn't matter. Here he comes now with the mop.
What happens when the fire alarm rings?
We tell our students to leave the classroom.
Can they take their belongings?
Yes, if they do it quickly.
Where do the students go?
They go out to the north parking lot.
What do the teachers do?
We take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll.
Why do you do that?
We want to make sure all the students are out of the building.
If they are all outside, then what?
Then we just wait outside for a fireman to tell us to go back in.
I have to go back upstairs.
Why? We're already late.
I have to check the stove.
What's the matter?
Maybe I left the burner on.
No, you didn't. I checked the stove before we left.
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
Well, I have to go back upstairs anyway.
It's getting later every minute.
I think I left the water running.
No, you didn't. Let's go! The only thing running is the clock!
The city is buying guns.
What are they paying?
Up to $200 for each gun, no questions asked.
Why are they doing this?
They want to get guns off the street.
Who would turn in a gun for $200?
That isn't a good deal?
A good gun costs $400 or more.
Well, if you bring your receipt, maybe they'll give you $400.
I'll keep my receipt and my gun.
I didn't know you had a gun.
Everyone in America should have a gun.
You're yawning.
I sure am.
You should go to bed.
I will as soon as I finish this article.
What are you reading?
It's about crime in Los Angeles.
What does it say?
The mayor says the crime rate is going down.
Then why does everyone lock their doors?
I guess they haven't read this article.
No one believes that the crime rate is going down.
Maybe the mayor is just talking about his own neighborhood.
People who live in California are crazy.
Why is that?
Because of all the earthquakes and fires.
But big earthquakes happen only once in a while.
Once in a while is once too many.
But you're right. There are a lot of fires.
A recent fire destroyed 85 homes.
Still, it's safer than Florida.
Florida doesn't have earthquakes or fires.
No, Florida just has hurricanes every year from June to October.
But most of those hurricanes are harmless.
Excuse me. Hurricane Andrew destroyed 30,000 homes!
I need a job.
I thought you had a job.
I did.
What happened?
I got laid off.
That's terrible! When did it happen?
I got laid off last week.
Just you?
No, ten of my coworkers got laid off, too.
What are you going to do?
I'm looking in the newspaper for a job.
Good luck!
Before you go to that interview, check yourself.
What's to check?
Are your nails clean?
Yes, they are.
Did you double-check your nose and teeth?
They are clean, too.
Did you shine your shoes?
My shoes are shined.
Do your socks match?
Of course they match.
No, they don't. One is black and one is dark blue.
Yikes! Thank you.
Life is hard.
It sure is.
I thought school was hard.
Me, too. I couldn't wait to graduate.
But now work is hard, too.
I agree. Work is just as hard as school.
Sometimes I wish I was back in school.
Me, too. School was fun.
And it was only 12 years.
It went by pretty fast.
But work goes on forever!
We have to work for 30 years!
I'm sleepy.
So am I.
I had a long day.
So did I.
I didn't even have lunch.
Neither did I.
I was busy the whole day.
So was I.
I had to bring work home with me.
I did too.
Your day was just like mine.
Of course it was. We work together!
I don't like my job.
What do you do?
I'm a babysitter.
Is that a lot of work?
Babies cry all the time.
You have to change their diapers.
I have to feed them.
Are you looking for another job?
No, I'm looking for another family.
Another family?
A family with only one baby.
That's a good idea.
I need a job.
What was your last job?
I was a painter.
What happened?
I got laid off because there was no work.
What else can you do?
I'm a handyman.
Can you fix a dripping faucet in a kitchen sink?
Of course.
Then I have a job for you in my kitchen.
It will cost you only $20 plus parts.
Okay. That sounds like a fair price.
What would you do if you lost your job?
I have no idea. I've been here for 20 years.
Do you have any other skills?
Well, I know how to flip hamburgers.
No one would hire you to flip hamburgers.
Have you heard something that you're not telling me?
What do you mean?
Are there going to be layoffs at this place?
I certainly hope not!
If you got laid off, you'd be flipping hamburgers, too.
Oh great, we could both work at Burger King.
Maybe we'd get laid off there, too.
Do your students ever talk about their jobs?
Yes, and they ask me what jobs are the best.
I tell my students to become a teacher.
Teaching is a great job.
It's the best job I've ever had.
What makes it so good?
For me, it's the students.
What do you mean?
I mean I have wonderful students.
That must be nice.
Teaching is the best part of my whole day.
You're a lucky man to have a job you love.
Boy, I'm glad that job is finished.
How long did it take?
Four hours, without a break.
It's always nice to finish a job.
Well, it's good and bad.
What's bad about it?
When you finish, all you do is start another job!
Yes, that's right. It does get boring.
Especially if it's the same work, over and over.
But that's what most people do.
Yes, I guess most of us are stuck in a routine.
I wonder if there is any job that you don't repeat over and over.
I think I have the worst boss in the world.
What makes him so bad?
He's rude and he yells a lot.
That's hard to take.
I've never heard him say please or thank you.
He sounds like a real jerk.
No one at work likes him.
Can't you report him to his supervisor?
Of course not. If I do that, I'll lose my job.
Yes, they don't like troublemakers or complainers.
I can't quit, because I'm making a good salary.
You shouldn't choose money over happiness.
What are we going to do?
About what?
About finding a job for me.
You don't need a job. I make enough money for both of us.
That doesn't matter. I don't want to sit around.
Okay, what kind of job do you want?
I'm not sure.
Well, you should do something that you enjoy.
I enjoy selling. I was born to sell.
Okay, what do you want to sell?
Cigarette lighters. I'll make a fortune.
But you hate cigarettes and you hate smoking!
A new hotel is looking for workers.
Yes, I saw it on the TV news.
They need 300 new workers.
And 4,000 people showed up.
So many people are out of work.
I still have my job, thank goodness.
So do I, but I'm worried.
Me too. There are no guarantees.
If you lose your job, you can move in with me.
Oh, thank you. That's very nice of you.
You would do the same for me.
Of course. What are friends for?
I think I did something real stupid.
What did you do?
I bought some stock.
Everybody buys stock.
I bought it on a hunch.
You didn't read about the company first?
I didn't have to. It's been in business for 60 years.
So what's the problem?
I used all my savings on this one company.
You put all your eggs into one basket.
If the company goes out of business, I'll have nothing.
Oh, you'll have something—you'll have a lesson you'll never forget!
I was going to be a doctor.
What happened to your plans?
I got a D in college chemistry.
Well, a D is better than an F.
A tutor helped me get the D!
So, you didn't become a doctor.
And now I'm glad that I didn't.
Why's that?
A hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.
Oh, yes, because of all the killer germs.
If you're a smart doctor, you stay away from hospitals.
Yes, the smart doctors are those TV news doctors—no hospitals, no patients.
I want to be a mail carrier when I grow up.
Why?
Because you get to meet a lot of people.
You sure do.
And you get a lot of exercise every day.
That's the truth.
And you get to play with a lot of dogs.
Well, you're supposed to be working.
Yes, but I will always pet the friendly dogs.
What about the unfriendly dogs?
I think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you.
Dogs are like people—not all of them are friendly.
I want to move to New York.
To the state or the city?
To the city, of course.
Why do you want to move there?
Because I want to make a lot of money.
There are a lot of poor people in New York.
There sure are—at least a million.
So how do you plan to become rich?
I will knock on the doors of all the corporations.
That won't make you rich. Nobody will talk to you.
I will keep knocking on doors.
All you will get is sore knuckles.
Hi Jack. What are you doing?
Hi Mary. I'm filling out a job application.
Are you finished with school already?
No. I have one more semester, but it would be great to have a job lined up.
How is your day going?
Quite busy. I'm preparing for my presentation tomorrow on our marketing strategy. I'm not even half done yet.
You must feel stressed out now.
That's an understatement.
What are you doing now?
I'm playing pool with my friends at a pool hall.
I didn't know you play pool. Are you having fun?
I'm having a great time. How about you? What are you doing?
I'm taking a break from my homework. There seems to be no end to the amount of work I have to do.
I'm glad I'm not in your shoes.
What are you doing now?
I'm watching TV.
What are you watching?
I'm watching Friends. What are you doing?
I'm doing my homework, but I really need to take a break.
You want to do something?
Yes. But I shouldn't. I got to finish my assignment now.
Alright. Call me later then.
OK. Bye.
Where are you going now?
I'm going to the bank.
Aren't you supposed to be at work?
I'm working now. I'm making a deposit for our company.
Where do you work?
I work for a restaurant as a controller.
Wow. That's great.
Great seeing you. I have to go now. I'll talk to you later.
Hi Steve. What are you doing here?
I'm meeting a friend here for dinner. How about you?
I'm on my way home but I needed to stop by the book store to buy a text book.
Didn't you finish school yet?
I have one more year, and then I'm done.
What are you majoring in?
I'm majoring in Sociology
How do you like your major?
I really find the subject very interesting. I'm enjoying all my classes.
That's great.
I'd better go now. I don't want to miss the bus.
Alright, I'll talk to you later.
Okay. See you later.
Hi! How are you?
Fine. How about you?
Me too. Have you completed your Maths note book?
Yes. Of course.
Can you help me with your notebook for a day or two?
What for?
Some of my homework is pending.
Sorry. I can’t give it to you for two days as I have to prepare for my
test.
But I must complete my homework.
And I must get my parents’ permission. I always keep them informed.
Are you scared of a scold ?
I am not afraid. And helping a classmate is nice to do.
Well, give me for a day.
Fine. Take it.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me. Is there a bank near here?
Yes. There's a bank on the corner.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Excuse me. Is there a supermarket near here?
Yes. There's one near here.
How do I get there?
At the traffic lights, take the first left and go straight on. It's on the left.
Is it far?
Not really.
Thank you.
Don't mention it.
Excuse me. Which road should I turn to reach Gurgaon?
Go straight, after about a Killometer, you will reach a roundabout. Take right and then turn left on first red light crossing.
Thank you for the help?
It’s all right.
Are you going to attend John’s birthday?
Yeah, I’m and what about you?
Me too. But I am unable to decide what to gift him.
Harry : Choosing gift is a difficult job. And I’m against spending parents’
money on such luxuries.
We don’t refuse when others give.
I think we should.
You mean we should just ignore friends on birthdays.
No…never. We must cheer them. We can gift a hand-made greeting
card.
No dear, that won’t look good.
Why? Greeting is the best way to express our love.
But it would be too cheap.
A real friend doesn’t need expensive gifts. He values the emotions.
But….
Look, I am going to gift him a card. Here it is!
It looks great dude! I will also gift him a card.
That’s great!
Mom, can I buy some candy?
No, not today.
But why?
You ate so much chocolate last week. I really think, it is a bad idea to
buy you more.
But….. Mom. please. I love chocolate so much.
I’d rather buy some fruit for you and make a lovely fruit salad for
you.
With ice-cream.
No, ice-cream is as bad as candy. You can have fruit but no ice-cream.
Then I don’t want fruit.
How about fruit cream?
Can we mix some ice-cream with it?
No. You don’t need ice-cream on it.
Mom, you are so strict.
I just want you to be healthy.
Wow! This is beautiful.
Good afternoon. May I help you?
Yes please. Do you have science educational CD’s?
Yes. For which class do you want?
Any, as I want it for my project work.
Here they are. You can choose from these.
How much does it cost?
It costs Rs. 99.
Fine. Please pack it. Do you have any project book?
What type? Do you mean Science projects ?
Rohan : Not exactly. We do projects as class work.
Not at this moment but you can check it out next week.
Please get it for me.
Sure!
Isn't it boring for you, lying on the sofa all day?
No, I enjoy resting. The whole night I stay awake and catch mice
and meet my friends.
I prefer to sleep on Saki's bed during the night. He is a very quiet
sleeper and doesn't know that I am there.
Right, you should really sleep on the mat.
Why can you sleep on the sofa while I have to sleep on the mat?
Because I am clean!.
That's true, I suppose..
But I don't mind if you sleep next to me on the sofa. I think you are
rather nice and cuddly.
Okay...move up. Aah, what a comfortable sofa!.
Yes, it is. Have a good sleep.
You too.
David have you completed your homework ?
Mam, yes I have but I could not fully understand the sums.
You could have asked me. And I know your elder brother goes to college. You could have taken his help.
Ma’m most often he remains busy on his laptop ?
I see, is he studying IT ?
No, he keeps glued to Facebook. What type of book is this ?
Facebook is not a book. It is a social networking site.
It’s a place on the internet where we can find our friends, send sms chat live and even invite new friends.
Can I also join it ? Do we learn from it.
Of course you can but I am doubtful of its learning value. Students need to spend their time studying or playing and interact with real friends.
You are right ma’m.
And other than heavily taxing your time, you may also be approached by
frauds . Lot of unknown people sent friendship requests.
You mean I should stay away from it.
That is another extreme. You can be on SN sites but set a time limit for it and check you are not addicted to it. What do YOU think We shouldn’t sit for long, wasting time parked on these sites as it affects our studies and health too. Thank you for your guidance.
Absolutely right. Rakesh and children you should never share your personal pictures or details as it can be misused.
Good morning, Abhay. How are you?
Good Morning Karan. Fine, thankyou ! So, both of us are early as usual.
Oh! I would never take a chance of missing the bus and reaching late to school.
Same here, and more so because I do not like to miss the morning assembly.
Do you have assembly everyday? Is it that interesting that you don’t want to miss it?
Not just interesting but very purposeful and educative.
Tell me something more about it. Abhay, you seem to enjoy it.
You know Karan, our assembly begins with a prayer , which is the essential part of it.
What do you think is the relevance of prayer , Abhay?
Well! Prayer is talking to God. Begin one with God, having faith and listening to God.
You’ve made it sound so simple and meaningful, Abhay.
Yes, our school has always guided us that way.
What else do you do in the assembly?
We have a hymn by the school choir followed by the news and thought for the day. This is followed by a quiz and group presentations.
What kind of presentations do you have?
Well! Karan we have items related to the assembly theme.
I never knew…. A theme for an assembly?
Yes, and that’s what makes the assembly so interesting.
Please tell me how do you celebrate the theme with the items?
Sure, I’ll give you an example. Last week , the theme was ‘seasons of India’ .Therefore there was a short quiz conducted by the students about the various seasons.
Oh! That’s a great idea.
Not just that Karan, the students of class 1 dramatized different seasons in the role play.
Dramatization in the assembly?
Yes, isn’t that wonderful and entertaining?
I would like to know more.
Sometimes our Principal also speaks and gives us wonderful tips. Sometimes we have a guest speaker.
That’s great ! No wonder you don’t want to miss the morning assembly. I wish our assembly was just as interesting.
Perhaps you too could start something similar in your school. Here come our buses.
Good morning! Madam.
Good morning. Sit down. What do you want?
I want admission into Sixth Standard.
Where did you study last year?
I studied in Tirumangalam.
Then why do you want admission here?
My father has been transferred to Madurai Branch.
What is your father?
He is a Bank Officer.
Where is he?
He is seated there. Shall I call him?
Fill in this application form and come in the afternoon.
Excuse me....
Yes?
Sorry, but could I bother your for just a minute? I think I left a book in this carrel last night. Could you just take a look in the shelf for me?
Sure. What's the title?
Uh..."Fundamentals of Bioengineering" or something like that- I forget the exact title. That's why I need it! It's a sort of green paperback.
Huh. Looks like a couple of other folks've left their books in here, too. Why don't they put them back where they got them when they're through, anyway?
Probably just forgot, like me. It's easy to forget a book in there after you've been sitting here going through books for three or four hours at night.
Yeah, I guess. I've done that, too. How about, um, "Engineering Basics"? Is this it? It's not green, though. It's kind of, uh, turquoise?
Huh! That's kind of eerie, isn't it? That's really pretty close. No, not mine. Nothing else there?
Nope. Just a couple of works on Anglo-Saxon grammar. Want those?
I don't think so! I probably need one on English grammar, though. My paper on GM is not organized very well.
GM? General Motors?
No. Gene modification. It's due next Tuesday and I'm barely half-finished. And I need that book to check the pagination- I'm including some quotes out of it.
Well, sorry I can't help- it's just not here. Did you check the stacks?
Yeah, 'cause I thought at first I'd put it back. But it's not where it's supposed to be, at least.
Maybe somebody else's got it then. Somebody from your class maybe?
Yeah, maybe. We've all got papers due.
Did you check at the desk? They can tell you if it's been checked out.
No- it can't be checked out. Our prof put it on reserve until the end of the term. Too many people might need to use it.
And there's only one copy? That's pretty rough.
Yup, I think so. Or... no- actually, I have no idea. I just presumed there was. I'll go check the catalogue!
Yeah- there might be another one in the Science Reading Room or the Medical Library. You know the author?
Uh.... Jamison, or um, Jamiston. Why?
Because I can search it for you right now- Google Scholar.
Huh?
Yeah, haven't your heard? University Libraries has linked up with Google's search of library holdings all over the world
Wow!
Just a sec. Jamison?....And the title's something about bioengineering, so keyword 'bioengineering'... and- voila! "Jamison, H.J., Fundamental Concepts of Bioengineering"- is that it?
Oh, yes! Great!
And...lessee... Tennyson University....yes, here we are: Main Library- and Medical Research Library! They've got a copy there, too, it says.
That is really great! Thanks so much for your help. I'm sorry I took up so much of your time. I really appreciate this.
My pleasure. It's my major.
Huh?
Library Science. You just gave me a little practicum
Well, glad to help, then. I've got to go! The Medical Library closes for the weekend Saturday afternoon.
Better run, then!
Thanks again! 'Bye.
Good luck!
Hi! How are you?
I'm fine.
You look worried. Is there any problem? You can share it with me.
Actually I am worried about my exams. There is only one week left for it. And I think I have not studied anything. I'm feeling nervous.
Oh!Just focus on your studies and you won't face any problem.
That's the problem. I can't concentrate.
These all happened to me too.And hence I started meditating.I t had a radical effect on my concentration power.
Friend:Thank you so much for your advice. I will surely follow it.
OK then bye.I'll meet you soon.
Bye Bye!
Dr Abercrombie: Good morning, Hanna. Thanks for coming in. How was your holiday?
Mr Fitch: It was very good, Professor, thanks. A week in the Appalachians is really therapeutic. Nothing to do but eat, sleep, and listen to nature. It's beautiful up there in the spring-- the countryside is so green-- and the people are so friendly and laid back. A good place to unwind.
I envy you. I've just got too much to get done to get away at all now. I must get this book finished, for one thing-- my publisher's getting impatient. I've outlined the last two chapters, though, finally, so it won't take me too much longer, I hope. Maybe I'll be able to go somewhere at Christmas. But, um, what I wanted to talk to you about is our syllabus for this term, Hanna. I know this is short notice, but I'd like to make a couple of little changes to it.
Uh oh! I know your idea of "little" changes!
No, no, I don't think it'll be that bad this time. What I'd like to do is, uh, cut Lectures Two and Three-- the ones on Old English and Middle English-- down to half their length and then meld them together into a single lecture. Then, with that extra ninety minutes, I want to add a lecture at the end on World Englishes. I think it's time we dealt with that more thoroughly, don't you?
Yessir, I certainly do. That's a good idea. So I guess I just need to cut down the quizzes to match and add a new one for World Englishes. Do you know when I'll be able to see your revised OE and ME notes?
I've already done a good bit of that revision, Hanna, and I think I'll have them ready for you before Lecture One. That's April eighth, I think?
Mr. Yes, Tuesday the eighth.
I've taken the segments on pronunciation out-- I think we can lose those easily enough. Nobody really needs to recite "Beowulf" or the "Canterbury Tales" any more-- no matter how much fun it is.
And that means you probably won't be discussing orthography much either?
I suppose not. I just want to be sure to point out clearly the main ways in which Modern English has developed from its predecessors. You know, the Great Vowel Shift, and so forth. Saving ninety minutes is not going to commit Old and Middle English to total oblivion, after all.
Not if you can help it, certainly! So I can eliminate the phonetics quiz completely, then?
Yes, I think so. I'll still give them a reading just so they can get a flavour of their ancestral tongue, but they can get as much of the phonetics as they want out of the textbook-- and it's rote learning anyway, really.
Now, what about your new lecture, then? Can I get started on any of that?
Yes, that's where I could really use your help in the next couple of weeks. I need you to research 'pidgins and creoles' for me. I've never paid enough attention to them, and I'd like an idea of the number there are, uh, their distribution, and uh, what linguists are saying about them these days-- are they English dialects? Derivative languages? What? See if you can find me some interesting examples and some specific quotes, will you?
Yes, of course. I think I know the kind of thing you're looking for. I'll take a look for internet sources this afternoon and then see what the library has later.
Thank you, Hanna, I'd appreciate that. And while you're there, would you see if they've got a copy of Burnley's source book on the history of English? I can't seem to find mine.
Oh. Uh... that's because you lent it to me last term... and erm, I haven't returned it yet.
Ah. Well. Get it back to me sometime soon, then, will you? I need to refer to it for my revisions.
Yessir, of course. Anything else on the syllabus?
Just that we'll need the student handout revised to reflect the changes. Who was in charge of that last time?
The department secretary has the file. I'll draft a revision, let you check it, and then give it to her, shall I? Shouldn't take long, and we just need to get photocopies before the first class.
All right, I'll leave that in your hands too then, Hanna. Just let me know if you need anything. And I'll see you at the faculty meeting tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, yes. Yes. The faculty meeting. Oh, and if you need any anecdotes on Appalachian English dialect, I'm your man-- I've just picked up a wealth of contemporary examples!
I'll keep that in mind. Thanks, Hanna.
Yes? Come in.
Excuse me, are you Mr Fitch? Dr Addlestone's assistant?
Hi. Yes. Can I help you?
Yes, please, if you have time. I'm Mary Jane Turner and I'm signed up for Literature Two-twenty? I just wanted to get clear on the grading system. I'm still not sure how it works.
Hi, Mary Jane. Sure. It's pretty straightforward, really. After each lecture, we prepare a short quiz on that material, and you take it at the beginning of the next lecture period. It only takes about ten minutes and it's pretty simple-- if you've taken good notes and studied them a bit beforehand, that is. There are fifteen lectures, so that's fifteen quizzes.
And they're part of our final grade, right?
Right. One percent each or fifteen percent for all fifteen of them.
Each one's only one percent of my grade? That doesn't seem like much. Missing one or two of them wouldn't make much difference, would it?
Not really, no-- but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. They're not worth much individually because they're very short and sweet-- just to check that you've been coming to class, really. But students who pass all fifteen quizzes earn a five percent, um, bonus for effort.
Don't our individual quiz scores count?
No, sorry. They're just pass-fail quizzes.
So, pass them all and it's twenty percent of my final grade?
That's right.
That sounds good.
And sixty percent are your mid-term and final exams.
Are they short and sweet, too?
No, I'm afraid not. They're not like the quizzes. They're ninety-minute tests and require a good bit of writing in addition to the objective questions. The mid-term covers the first eight lectures, the Founding Fathers to Mark Twain. The final mainly covers World War One to the present, from Lecture Nine on.
So first-half authors won't be on the final?
That's not what I said. I said it's MAINLY on the second half of the course. Professor Addlestone will be keeping you, uh, honest with a few questions about American literature before the first World War, too.
I see. And they're thirty-thirty?
Yes, thirty percent for the mid-term, thirty percent for the final, and up to twenty percent for the weekly quizzes. And then up to ten percent each for your essays. You'll need at least ninety percent for an A, eighty percent for a B, and seventy percent for a C.
Erm....could you tell me something about what is expected with our essays? There're two of them, right?
Yes. You're required to write two short critical essays on American authors of your choice, from anywhere in American literary history, and we'll be looking carefully at your writing style and ability as much as at the content of your essays. The Professor's a real stickler for overall literacy.
So I can choose any author in the syllabus?
Yes, but I can tell you that we often like it when a student picks an author out of the mainstream-- perhaps a lesser writer that we haven't been able to include in the lectures, or a contemporary author who hasn't, uh, hasn't found a place in literary history yet.
Someone really obscure?
Not a good idea. The author you choose should have some relevance to the course of American literature. And if you can demonstrate that relevance clearly in four to five typewritten pages, then you'll have a good essay.
For each essay? Ooh.
This is a university, uh, Mary Jane, not a high school. Now, you've got almost four months to write eight to ten pages. You should be able to manage that.
Yes, OK. You're right. When are they due?
Your first essay's due in late October. It must be handed in by Lecture Eight, but we'd be happy to see it anytime before that. And the second is due at the last lecture in December. It must be turned in before the winter break.
Oh-- should the first essay be about somebody in the the first half's material then? And the same for the second?
No, not at all. Any author you like. It would be smart to choose ones that interest you, though. Papers that reflect some, um, enthusiasm always turn out better.
Oh, I've got that! I'm really looking forward to this course-- I love reading!
That's good, because you'll be doing a lot of that.
Thanks for your help, Mr Fitch-- I really appreciate it.
And don't be shy if you have any more concerns, Mary Jane. My door's always open. Good-bye.
Now, then, Mr., uh, Vickstad. How can I help you?
Well, I'm thinking about transferring, but I'm, I'm not sure ... I was hoping you could help me make a decision.
I'll try. Where are you thinking of transferring to? And why do you want to leave Kryptos U?
Um...I'm thinking of going to Central University, because it's in my hometown. I've uh, been kind of homesick here this year, and I haven't made many friends...I just feel so lonely. So, I thought that uh, maybe, it'd be better to be closer to my parents and friends and all.
I see. And would you keep the same major if you transferred? What is it...business administration?
Yeah, I would. The credits I've earned here will transfer to Central. I've already checked.
May I ask why you chose to come to Kryptos University in the first place?
Sure. Um, well, the main reason is you have a great business school. And the second reason is that I...I wanted to get away from home.
You're right, Mr. Vickstad, we do have an excellent business school. But, so does Central. The thing is, you've got almost a year under your belt here now. At Central, you'll be starting from scratch.
Yeah, I know that. But I'm a little bit familiar with Central, 'cuz I had older friends who went there, and I visited it before I came here.
You know, freshman year is usually the hardest. I remember how homesick I was my first year. I'll tell you, I was ready to pack it in after the first two weeks. But the longer I stayed, the more comfortable I felt. By senior year, I was glad I chose to stay.
Really? Did it get a lot better your sophomore year?
Yes, it did. You might well find the same is true for you. Also, even though your credits here will transfer, you will have to take extra courses, because Central has different requirements. You'll probably have to go to school for an extra year.
Hmm...I hadn't thought about that. I'll have to check into it. Maybe I should give it one more year. I mean, it's probably good for me to learn to live away from my family and friends, right? It'll make me stronger in the future.
You can always move back there after you graduate. Of course, by that time you may not want to!
Thank you for all your help. I guess I'll find out the exact transfer requirements. You've given me a lot to think about.
can I come in?
Oh, hi. Sure! You must be Roger?
Yes. And you're Terry, uh, Lawrence?
Yep. So we're roomies this year, eh? Nice to meet you.
Good to meet you, too.
Well, uh, I guess the first thing is-- which bunk do you want?
Ha! Oh, I don't mind, really. The top's fine. You can have the lower one.
OK, thanks, I'll take it! I am a bit afraid of falling off. I did that more than once when I was a kid. It doesn't hurt, really, but it sure knocks the wind out of you!
 Well, I'll try not to roll over in my sleep. Actually, it looks like fun sleeping up there. I've never slept in a bunk bed before, though. What's your major?
Oh, I'm supposed to be in pre-med, but I've been taking a lot of electives. I might change it. What's yours?
I'm just an aggie. We've got a ranch out west of Houston, and I'm thinking I might become a vet. You're pre-med? Then you've taken Chemistry One Twenty-one? It's a required course for me, and I'm not good in chemistry at all. Maybe I could borrow your notes?
Hah! "Bonehead Chemistry"-- no, sorry. I still have to take that, too. Hey, maybe we could sign up for the same sections.
Yeah, that's a good idea!
When do you register?
Oh. Let me see. Wait a sec. Uh...ah, here it is: ten a.m. Monday.
Great! I register at nine. The Bonehead lectures are Tuesdays and Thursdays, and the labs are Monday-Wednesday-Friday afternoons. I can register first and then let you know which sections I've got before you register at ten. What times are good for you?
Oh gosh. Maybe, early lectures and a Friday lab? I think better in the morning, and that's going to be a tough course.
I know. That's why I'm thinking about switching majors-- the science prerequisites are really awful. But I'll give it one more semester before I pack it in. You sure you want a Friday lab? It'll cut your weekend short.
Yeah, but I'm gonna have a full load this semester, so I gotta take something Friday anyway. Might as well be something I can cut.
OK then. So, should I meet you back here Monday about nine-thirty? I can give you my schedule then.
Uh, how about in the cafeteria? I'd like to get some coffee before I start-- I'll need the energy. And it's handier anyway.
Sure, that's fine-- let's do that, then. But maybe we'd better get a little organized around here. I've already put my clothes in the left-hand dresser. Do you mind if I set one of my stereo speakers on the corner of the right-hand one?
No, that's OK. I didn't bring much stuff-- just the basics till I know what I need. If I need that space later, we can hang the speaker on the wall.
And I took over half the closet.
That bookcase looks pretty small. Most of my stuff is books.
Yeah, I've got a lot of those, too-- and we haven't even got this term's texts yet.  D'you think we could get one the same size from Campus Stores and put it on top of that one? They've got a free furniture place there.
Well, we could at least run over and take a look. I'll bet the bookcases are all gone, though-- they're going to be a popular item. Tell you whaI'll go over there after I see you Monday morning. Maybe they'll have an early-bird special.
OK, good. And if they don't, we'll just have to make do for now.  Shoes.
Huh?
Where can we put our shoes? Where'd you stash yours?
Oh. There, under the bed. One advantage of sleeping on the bottom bunk.
Wait a minute!
Just kidding. Stuff whatever you like under there, too. Half is yours. Just got those two bags?
No, I've also got two cartons of books and junk coming later. I'll worry about them then. All your stuff here?
Yep. But I need to go to a drugstore and pick up some toilet paper and kleenex sometime soon. Wanna come?
Yes, that's just what I have to do, too-- get some toothpaste and stuff. Gimme a minute and we can go together now.
Clerk: Can I help you? Are you looking for something in particular?
Student: Yes, well... first I'm looking for the foreign language section.
Oh, it's right down here. Here we are. "Foreign Languages". What course are you taking?
Spanish Four Thirty-one.
You need the Intermediate Spanish textbook?
No, I still have that from Four Thirty. What I'm looking for is the novel we're supposed to read: Garcia Marquez's 'Cien años de soledad'-- 'One Hundred Years of Solitude'.
'Garcia Marquez', 'Garcia Marquez'. Hmm. No... Oh, here it is, under 'Marquez'. Here you are.
Eighteen dollars? The price is right, but, erm, it's just the text. There don't seem to be any footnotes or any glossary.
Ah.
This is the only edition you have?
Yes, it is. Sorry.
Hmm. How many copies do you have left? Just those on the shelf?
Yes, uh, four-- no, five copies.
Jeez, those'll be gone by Friday for sure. Our class is really full. What's your return policy? Would it be OK if I bought this now, and then returned it if I can find an annotated edition on the internet?
Yes, certainly. But you'll need to keep your receipt, of course, and be sure that the book is not marked up or damaged in any way.
Sure, that's fair enough.
Did you want me to check whether we can find you another edition?
I don't think I have time. It usually takes so long to get a book through a bookstore.
 Unfortunately, that's often true.
Thanks anyway. I'll take this then, and say-- you have, uh, sweatshirts, don't you?
Sweatshirts? Yes, in the 'School Spirit' section. Over this way. And down here. Um. Here you are.
Ah. Yes. Hmm....that's not much of a school crest.
Oh.  There's a bigger one on the back, see?
Oh, yeah, of course. I see. Uh, this is a medium. I need a large, and uh...I think...in green.
Medium, medium...here, is this a large? Yes, large. Here you go.
Yeah, that's good. Say, do you know what our motto means, anyway? "Ex Pertinacia Veritas". "Out of something....something-or-other."
"From Determination comes Truth". It's been SU's motto since it was founded in 1894. And this crest is "an American bison couchant upon a tome vert".
What in heck does that mean?
A buffalo lying on a green book. I think the idea was that this new pioneer state was getting its first institution of higher education-- the buffalo represents the prairies-- the green of the book-- and the book represents learning.
Huh. That's really interesting. I'll wear it with pride-- and hope for some of that determination! How much is this?
$39.95 plus tax.
Fine. Uh, what else do I need now? Mmm.... I guess that's it, then: the sweatshirt and the book.
And there's no tax on the book.
Where's your register?
Just take them up to the cashier at the front, please. Over there.
Oh, OK. Thanks a lot for your help.
R1: Next.
Hi. Chemistry One Twenty-one, morning lectures. Are sections-- ?
R1: Oh, sorry, you're at the wrong table. This is Upper Division sciences. University College courses are at Tables Four through Nine.
Really? Damn.
R1: Let's see. Chemistry? You want Table Five, Physical and Social Sciences.
OK, thanks very much. (He goes.)
Next, please.
Good morning. Have you got Bone-- uh-- Chemistry One Twenty-one here?
Yes. Could I see your student ID card, please?
Here you are.
Thank you. Now... One Twenty-one...what sections would you like?
Uh, Tuesday and Thursday, Sections One or Two?
There're spaces available in both of those. Section One starts at seven forty-five a.m. and Two is from nine to ten.
Well, seven forty-five's a little early for me. It's the same lecturer for both sections, isn't it?
Sorry, you'll have to check that in your Course Guide.
How many spaces are left in Section Two?
It's a little early for a lot of students. Section One still has about forty spaces left, but Two only has ten.
Rats. I want to be in the same section as my roomie, but he doesn't register until ten today, and by then, those may be gone. All right, give me Section One, please.
There you are. And what about your lab section?
I think any Friday section is OK for me.
Section Twenty-one is twelve to two o'clock, Section Twenty-two is one to three, Section Twenty-three is two thirty to four thirty, and Section Twenty-four is three thirty to five thirty.
All right then, let me have the one-to-three o'clock one. Section Twenty-two?
R: Yes, there you are.
Thanks. And can I register for Ethology Two Sixty-three here, too?
Yes. But, um... there's only one section in that course: Monday-Wednesday-Friday from one o'clock to two. You've got a conflict with your chem lab.
Oh, no! 
Do you want your laboratory on a different day?
No. Uh, what were the times on those other lab sections again?
Twelve to two, one to three, two thirty to four thirty, and three thirty to five thirty.
I'll take two thirty to four thirty, then. Could I change this card for that one? Sorry.
Sure, here you go. And here's your section card for Ethology.
Thanks very much. Are there plenty of spaces left in Twenty-three?
They won't go in an hour. Your friend should have no trouble getting one. Is that it now?
That'll do it, thanks.
OK. Please print your name and student number clearly in the blanks on each card.
OK. "Ter-ry...mm...eight four four four one...mmm...." There you are.
And don't forget to write these into your class schedule: Chemisty One Twenty-one, Lecture Section One, Tuesday and Thursday, seven forty-five. Laboratory Section Twenty-three, Friday, two thirty. Ethology Two Sixty-three, Monday-Wednesday-Friday, one to two p.m.
Thanks very much for your help!
Oh, there you are.
Hi. Did you get the classes you wanted?
Not really. My Physics lectures are eight to nine in the morning Tuesday and Thursday. Those're gonna be killers. I'm gonna need two alarm clocks. And I got a Friday lab from two to four. I couldn't get an earlier one because they conflict with my Biology course. It's only has one section, so I have no choice there.
Those Friday classes sure spoil a four-day week, don't they?  Want some coffee?
Uh, sure. You still got time before you register?
There's still a few minutes till ten, and they don't let you start early. They're pretty strict-- they won't let you in there till your time comes.
That's because it's so crowded, I guess. Registering eighteen thousand students in four days makes it pretty busy over there.
I'll be right back. (He gets them coffees.) There you are.  Coffee. I'm gonna be drinking a lot of that this semester.
Me too, I guess.
Did you pick up a cafeteria cash card yet?
No, not yet. I've gotta go to the bank first. The biggest card they've got is a hundred dollars, isn't it?
I think they've got a two-hundred dollar one this year. Prices have gone up so much they've added a new denomination-- like Zimbabwe does! But I've still got some money on my last year's card, so I haven't checked for sure yet.
Well, I'll take out two hundred bucks just in case. Might as well get the biggest one-- I'll be using it all, that's for sure. I practically live over here. It's a good place to study.
Can I sublet your half of the room then? 
 Gee, maybe we should. Pick up some extra money. They say there's a real shortage of dorm space this year.
How come? The student body's about the same as last year, I think. Or smaller-- tuition's gone up again and I'll bet some students just couldn't afford it this year, with this slow economy.
No, it's because they tore down Dormitory A to put up a new one-- but all they've got is the shell so far. That plumbers and electricians strike this summer sure threw a monkey wrench into the construction schedule. It won't be finished now till the end of December at least.
Wow! There must've been five hundred rooms in Dorm A! That's a big dent in campus housing, all right. Are they doing anything about it?
Well, I hear the Housing Office is trying to lease as many off-campus units as they can find, but most of them are rented to students already.
Too bad. I wouldn't want to live off-campus anyway, though.
Why not?
Well, it's so cheap and easy to live right here. The rent's less than half of what we'd have to pay out there, and we're right on campus within a few minutes of everyplace. The only problem is the roommates they give you.
 Yeah? Well, you're stuck with this one for the rest of the year at least, pal! But y'know, of we stayed roomies, we could share the rent on an apartment somewhere not too far off. So it wouldn't cost that much-- and think of the parties we could throw! You can't have a real party in a dorm room.
Huh! Yeah. That's something to think about. Let's keep our eyes open for a place for next year, then.
Hi, I want to get a pass for the Intramural Activities Center this quarter, please.
Sure. In need to see your student ID card, please. OK, thank you. Now, which type of IMA pass would you like to buy?
Um, I don't know. How many different kinds of passes are there?
Well, there's a basic pass. That allows you to use the basketball courts, the fitness center, the racquetball courts, the rock-climbing center, and the indoor track. An IMA super pass lets you use all those things, and also the swimming pools, tennis courts, and golf driving range. Then we have, um, specialized passes for just the swimming pools and the fitness center.
Man, I didn't know this was going to be so complicated. Um, so the basic pass includes basketball, the fitness center, racquetball, and, uh, what else?
The rock-climbing center and the indoor track. It costs $50 for the quarter.
And the Super Pass has all those things, plus swimming, tennis, and the golf driving range, right?
Yes, that's correct. The super pass is $75 for the quarter. It also permits you use the IMA Center during the two-week Christmas vacation, if you're going to be here.
So, the basic pass is $50 for the quarter, and the super pass is, uh, 75, but the super pass it gives you two extra weeks. And um, you mentioned there were also special passes?
Yes, we have a swim-only pass for $35. This lets you use either one of our two swimming pools, plus the sauna and whirlpools in the locker room. There's also a pass for the fitness center only. It costs $40, and gives you access to all the weight machines and fitness machines, as well as the locker- room sauna and whirlpools.
All right, let's see if I've got this straight. The swim pass is $35, and the fitness center pass is $40. And both of these include access to the whirlpools and saunas in the locker room?
Correct. Oh, and one other thing I forgot to mention is that the fitness pass includes a 15-percent discount on all of our IMA sports and fitness classes.
What kinds of sports and fitness classes do you have?
Oh, my! We have several different kinds of dance classes, yoga, aerobics, swim conditioning, Tae Kwon Do....here's a brochure with all the details.
Thanks. So, these classes, there's an extra fee for them, even if I have a super pass?
I'm afraid so, because we have to pay the teachers' salaries and the cost of equipment.
OK. Uh, mmm...oh yeah, what about someone who isn't a university student? Is there some kind of pass that they could buy?
No, I'm afraid not. IMA passes are only offered to registered students and faculty. Guests have to be accompanied by a student or faculty member. They pay $10 each time they come.
Can students pay the same way, I mean, each time they come?
Yes, but if you're going to come very often it's better to buy a pass. The student price is $5 per visit. If you use the IMA even once a week, you'll save money buying a pass.
Well, thanks for all the information. There are so many choices, I can't make a decision right now. I'll think about it, then come back later in the week.
No problem. We're open Monday through Thursday from 8 to 12, then 1 to 4:30, and from 1 to 5:30 on Friday. If you have any more questions, you can call the phone number on the brochure.
Good afternoon, Mr. Pennington. You are in my, um, American History 201 class, right? How can I help you today?
It's about my term paper. I, uh, I know it's due next Monday, but, um, I was hoping...I don't think I can get it done by then. Could I please turn it in by the end of next week instead? I have a really good excuse.
Oh I'm sure you do! [chuckles]. I've been teaching 33 years. Do you know how many excuses I've heard? "My dog ate my paper." "My roommate had a party so I couldn't concentrate." "I have seven papers due on the same day!" "I went home to see my parents and my car broke down." My favorite was a student who told me she "forgot" all about her term paper until the day before it was due. It's amazing she remembered to come to class.
[Laughs nervously] I didn't forget, sir. I've been working on the paper, really! Here, I brought my outline and a rough draft. It's, um, just that...well, a lot of things have been going on in my life, and I'm having trouble managing things.
I see. You know, I assigned that paper four weeks ago, and I've been reminding students about it in each class. So, tell me your story. What's happening in your life?
First, about two weeks ago, my roommate found out his mother is real sick. She has breast cancer. So he's been really upset, and, uh, I went home with him for a couple of days to see his mom. That caused me to miss biology lab, and I have a huge biology final coming up on Tuesday that I really need to study for this weekend. Then I got the flu last week, and missed a day of class. I tried to work on your paper that day, but I really felt horrible...
OK, I can understand that. I'm glad that you're, er, helping your roommate through a tough time. That's more important than school work. But all this seems to have happened recently. What about the two weeks after I first assigned the term paper?
I, uh [sheepishly]...I guess I didn't use that time very well. I kind of put off getting started on it.
[Sighs]. Yes, you did. You know, if I had a dollar for every time I've heard a student say that...
I'm sorry, Professor Dalton. I've learned my lesson. If I had spent just a little bit of time each week on the paper, I could have had it done on time. I know now that I need to plan for unexpected things.
You seem like a bright, conscientious young man, Mr...your first name's Jack, isn't it? When I was a young student, an upperclassman gave me some advice that I've never forgotten. He said, "You're going to find yourself with a lot of small gaps during school days -- 15 minutes, or half and hour. What you do during those gaps will make a big difference in how successful you are."
Wow! That's great advice.
Yeah, I thought so. And I still do. So I'll tell you what. You can turn your paper in no later than 9 a.m. Friday, right here on my office desk. In exchange for this favor, I want you to pass that advice on to all your friends and dorm mates.
Thank you, professor Dalton! You bet I will.
Yes, how can I help you?
I'd like to buy a campus parking pass for next year.
Certainly. Did you want a limited or unlimited? And just for fall quarter, or for the entire school year?
I was thinking of one for the whole year, but I'm not sure. Does the year include summer quarter? 'Cause I won't be here then.
No, summer term is extra. The year includes fall, winter and spring quarters. A yearly pass is valid only from the start of fall term to the end of spring term. This year, that's, uh, let's see...[rustling paper] Sept. 22nd to June 7th.
Oh, OK. And you said there were two different kinds? Uh, limited and unlimited?
Yes. A limited pass lets you park in any campus lot only on days school is in session. During holidays and on weekends, you would have to pay the normal parking rate. With an unlimited pass, you can park in any lot on any day during the school year, including weekends and holidays. Like I said, between Sept. 22nd and June 7th.
Hmm...how much do they cost?
A limited pass is $100, and an unlimited is $150.
All right, I'll buy an unlimited, I guess. What do I have to do?
First, I'm going to give you a registration form. This gives us information about your car. Fill it out, and bring it back to me when you're ready. You can pay by cash, check, or credit card. Then, I'll give you a sticker to put on the corner of your windshield. Make sure that sticker is in place when you park. Otherwise, you will get a ticket.
No problem. So, um, does this pass guarantee that I'll get a parking space? I mean, are there, like, special places set aside in each lot for people with parking passes?
That's a good question. Uh, unfortunately, the answer is no. Parking is on a first-come, first-serve basis. If a lot is full, you'll have to park somewhere else, or wait until another car leaves.
I see. How much does, um, regular parking cost? Without a pass?
It's two dollars an hour, or $10 a day. You're getting an excellent deal.
Thank you. Oh, just one more question. Do you need all the money up front, or can I make payments?
Will you pay?
Yeah.
I'll get the trays, then.
OK. Thanks.
Here you are. Ladies first.
Ah. Mmm. Lessee...what've they got for salads? Caesar...spinach...garden....
What's the difference? They're all mostly lettuce anyway.
Maybe, but I like... croutons.. Caesar's for me.... Oh, hand me some, uh, oil-and-vinegar, will you?
Here. Hmm... And the lettuce looks wilted. Fruit for me, I guess.
Grapes? I thought you didn't like them.
I don't like the green ones, that's all.
Oh.
And lessee.... Today's entrees are- Salisbury steak...buffalo wings...filet of sole...and uh, veal cutlets. Hmm. I guess I'll have fish again.
Why? Low cholesterol?
No, it just looks better than the rest. Like it might be edible.
I see. (To the server) Give me the veal please, with, uh, mashed potatoes and, um, string beans, I guess.
Did you finish your homework?
For Art History? Sort of. I've got my talk down, I think. But I've still got to make copies of one of his paintings for the class. I thought I'd do that right after lunch- it won't take a minute.
Who've you got again?
Turner. I found a really great print of his- "Landscape with Walton Bridges" it's called. (To the server) Oh, thank you.
(To the server) And I'll have the sole. And fries, and, uh, succotash. (To Betty) Are you going to make color copies? They're not cheap.
Yeah, but they're worth it. "Walton Bridges" is really fantastic. I'll show you when we sit down.
OK. (To the server) Oh. Thanks.
Lessee...silverware....
Yeah...mm...napkin? Here.
Oh, thanks, yeah. And, um... iced tea for me.
Mm...and me, too. Hmm. All right. OK, let's find a table!
Um. Oh- how about over there, by the window?
Yes, that's good. I need some table room.
What for?
Uh, well... I've still got some organizing to do. Same class.
Ah. (They sit down to eat) Who are you talking on?
Dali. Chow down!
Eh?
Salvador Dali. You know, the surrealist. The guy with the moustache.
Oh, yeah! The guy with the moustache. Do you think he was crazy?
Crazy like a fox, maybe. He made a lot of money later on his career, cranking out trash for the most part. He put on a real, um, show, though, didn't he?
Sure did.
But I really admire his imagination- some really wild stuff, those melted clocks and hollow beasts. Very evocative images. And actually, he did a lot of research. Do you know the story about his Corpus Hypercubus?
His what?
It's a cubist painting of the Crucifixion- you know, of Christ on the Cross.
No, what's the story?
Well, you'll have to wait for class- I'm still working on it.
Aw, c'mon!
No, I can't, really. It's about the mathematics he used, but I've gotta tell it right. And I gotta get that together right after lunch! Can I see your Turner print, though?
Oh. Yes, sure. I've got it right, um...here.
Wow.
Isn't that great? Look at that light!
It's so Italianate- the pastoral atmosphere is so thick you could cut it with a knife! Turner's so modern, isn't he? All colour and mood, and almost no form, except for these wispy trees here. Truly amazing! There's every imaginable shade of gold in there, isn't there?
Can you believe this was painted before the middle of the 19th century?
Really, eh? Are you going to eat the rest of that salad?
No, you can have it. Here. Are you going to stay here and finish your presentation?
Yeah. We've still got over an hour before class.
OK, then. I'm going to just run over to the Campus Shop and get this xeroxed and then come back. How many do I need? Ten?
Plus one for Dr Auburn- that's eleven. But if they're too expensive, I don't need one. I've seen it already.
It's not going to break me. You get one too. See you.
Oh- hi, Cecille. What are you doing here so early?
Hi, Robert. Oh, I got tired of sitting in the cafeteria, that's all. I have an hour break before this class, and I usually, uh, spend it there... but it's so noisy today! Why are you here early?
Oh, I always come in about now- it's a quiet place to go over my notes before class.
Gee, aren't you the eager beaver!
I just find it's a, a good way to review and at the same time try to keep up with, uh, with where this course is going. Cost Accounting is pretty difficult for me. Why's the cafeteria so noisy? There shouldn't be many people there at three in the afternoon. Lunch is done.
There's a sort of rally going on- for the demonstration.
Demonstration?
Yeah, Friday.
Really? Against what? What's it about?
Tuition. It's about the tuition increase.
Oh, yeah, the tuition increase. They're holding a demonstration?
You don't get around campus much, do you? They've got posters plastered up all over the place.
No, I guess I don't. I just come in for this class and for, um, Financial Management Thursday nights. I didn't think this fee rise was such a big thing, though. It seems to happen couple of years or so, regular as clockwork.
Well, I guess this one was just the last straw.
Why's that?
Because the economy's so bad. Students don't have any money. Their parents don't have any money. They just can't afford to pay any more for school right now.
I suppose that's so. I manage, but I haven't had a raise in more than four years myself.
You're working?
Yeah. That's why I'm taking only two classes. I'm a bookkeeper.
A bookkeeper? Where at?
Lightsey Furniture, downtown. I've been working there part-time since before I started Accounting School, three days a week. That's- It's enough to pay my expenses, even the tuition boost- if I'm careful with my money.
You don't have such big fees to pay, though, if you're just taking those two classes. With a full load, most of us are having to fork out close to five hundred dollars more a term!
Ouch! I'd protest at that too, I guess. Are you going?
To the demonstration? I dunno. I've been thinking about it, but, well, I'm not really one to, uh, climb on the bandwagon.
It's turning into that, is it?
Seems to be- there's a lot of people over at the cafeteria, anyway, and they seem pretty enthusiastic about this thing.
Don't you think this might be just a "college thing", though? Students getting riled up just for the sake of getting riled up? We're so righteous, so sensitive to injustices. UBC must have a good reason for raising its tuition, I'm sure- it's a non-profit institution, for heaven's sake!
Oh, no doubt, no doubt. Student idealism? Some of that too, I guess, but-
But- it's hard times. I get it. And how's your economy?
Oh, I'm OK. My money comes from Daddy's education trust.
Trust? You must be rich!
I wish. No, this isn't a trust like a Rockefeller trust! This is a fancy savings account Daddy started when I was born. He put a little money into it every month, and over- what?- eighteen years, that grew to enough to get me through university. And God bless Daddy!
Amen! Good for you!
Yeah, I'm lucky- and I've got enough to finish out my last year now, no problem. But a lot of others, they're not so lucky. Some of 'em aren't going to be able to finish school- they just don't have another five hundred or a thousand dollars in their budget.
What time is that protest Friday?
I think it starts at four, why? Thinking of going?
 Yeah, I am, actually. I'd like to get a few more details first, though. Do you know where-
There's some flyers in the cafeteria and over at the Student Union, and at some other places on campus, I guess. You could pick one of those up.
Yes, I think I will. After class.
Tell you what- I'll go with you. And if you decide to participate Friday, I'll meet you there.
Or we could meet somewhere else first.
And make placards and headbands? 
Maybe. Anyway, it would be easier than trying to find you in the crowd. And we could plan our escape if it gets too rough.
Gee, do you think it could?
Oh, probably not. But it's better to be safe than sorry.
Yeah, I suppose so.
Sorry- you can't park your bike here, son.
Huh? Why not? There's a lot of bikes already here.
Yeah, but they all got Lot H stickers.
They've got what?
Lot H stickers. Permits to park here in Lot H- see?
Oh. Well, where can I park instead?
Nowhere. You ain't got no sticker. You gotta have a permit for some parking zone before you can park that thing anywhere on campus.
Ok, then...well...can I get one today, do you think? Where do we get them?
If you got your student ID card for this term, yes, you can get one today....
Yeah, I've got that, yes....
And you can apply for it at the Campus Affairs Office.
Where's that?
Just next to the Student Union, on the west side of it.
That little brown building?
Yessir, that's it.
And- are they free?
Nope, 'fraid not.
Do you know how much they cost, then?
It depends. The main building zones are ten dollars, I think, and the outer zones are five- but you'll have to check with them.
OK. Thanks.
Sure. Say, what is that thing, anyway?
It's a Thorn Raven.
Don't look cheap.
No, it's not. I'm into touring bikes.
Well, that sure looks like a good one. Ride a lot?
Yes, you could say so. I took this one across the country.
Across America?!
Yep, Atlantic to Pacific, all the way.
Whew! How long did that take you, anyway?
Three months.
You must've been awful tired by the end.
More mentally than physically, actually. You can get used to riding the bike eight hours a day, I mean, with a comfortable seat and comfortable clothes and all- but you never stop worrying about the traffic and potholes and flat tires and your schedule and... you know. And stuck out in the desert as the sun goes down, with no motel or gas station in sight- you feel pretty lonely and, uh, vulnerable.
Huh?
Vulnerable? You know, kind of unprotected.
Ah. Yeah, I guess so, eh? But that's an exciting thing you done, son. During summer break?
Yes, last year. I'd gotten my scholarship, so I didn't need to get a job last summer, and I planned that trip instead. New York to San Francisco- crossing the continent is something I've always wanted to do. Once.
Once?
Yeah. I won't do it again.
Just too hard, huh?
Not just that. It took a lot of time and a lot of money, and I'm not going to have that kind of free time again now until I retire from work maybe. 
Well, just stay healthy, son, and maybe you can do it again when you're 65.
Yeah, maybe. Say, do you know this town very well?
Sure do. Born here. What're you lookin' for?
Is there a good bike shop? Maybe even a Thorn dealer?
Nope, no dealer, but there's a durn good bike shop. 'S called 'Wheels Within Wheels'- downtown off Elm Street.
Elm Street? Hmm. Didn't see the shop. I was down there looking around Sunday.
Well, it's not exactly on Elm Street- it's just off it, down the alley between Oak and Maple. Y'know where the Pizza Plaza is?
Yeah.
All right, it's around that corner. It ain't big, but it's a good shop, got everything you want, I expect, or leastwise what you need. And old Buster's been fixin' bikes for almost thirty years now.
You used him?
No. No bicycle. But he's my wife's cousin. And I ain't heard a complaint against him in the last twenty years.
Well, that's a good enough recommendation for me. I'll check him out next Sunday.
What'cha need?
Oh, now I just want to pick up a spare tube in case I get a flat tire. I don't have a spare.
Well, he's got those, sure- any size you like. Fix your own flats, do you? You must be a serious biker.
Well, I don't really like the job, but, you know, it's hard to find a repair shop sometimes, out in the middle of nowhere- and that's where I always seem to catch my flats.
Ain't that the way!
Sure is. Well, thanks. I gotta go get that permit before the office closes, I guess.
All right. Take care, son.
You too. See you. 'Bye.
You look lost.
That's because I am.
What're you looking for?
I'm trying to find Q22. Building Q22.
Q...?
It's supposed to be behind the Flagler Arts Hall here, but there's nothing there but trees that I can see.
Can't see the forest for the trees, huh? Where'd you get that map?
Oh, it's from our orientation guide. I didn't want to carry the whole thing around with me, so I just tore out the map. 
Huh. Good idea. Can I see?
Sure. Here. See- we're here, Circle Road, right? And here's the Arts Hall, right here, number eighteen....
Yeah...mmm....
And then Q22 is right- here. Behind it.
Yes, but...which way are we facing? Look- Circle Road curves around the Arts Hall, and we're...uh...we're here, on the left side of the building, see?
Huh? Oh...then...Q22 must be...around to the...right of the Hall from here.
C'mon, let's check. I'll go with you.
Thanks, but you don't have to....
Naw, that's OK. I'm curious.
Thanks, then.
You're a freshman, aren't you?
How'd you guess? 
'Cause I was one myself a couple of years ago. I couldn't find my physics laboratory till the second week.
Really? 
Yeah, and it was in a Quonset, too.
A what?
A Quonset- a Quonset hut- that's what the 'Q' stands for. It's an old US Army hut.
An Army hut? Was this a military base before?
No. After the Second World War, all the GIs came home, and a lot of them went back to college on the GI Bill.
What's that?
The GI Bill? Oh, the government offered returning soldiers almost a...an almost free education. And the state universities were flooded with students. They were...they suddenly needed a lot of extra classrooms and dormitory space. And the federal government responded by giving them a lot of, well, temporary structures that were no longer needed by the military. Perfect recycling, eh? And there's one now! Q22!
Wow! That's a funny-looking thing. It looks like the top half of a big sewer pipe or something.
Yep, not very elegant, I'm afraid- but very practical. And cold in the winter; the thing's poorly insulated. But they were a good quick fix to the problem of growing enrollment.
Jeez- they set these up in the fifties, and we're still using them in 2009? These things are more than fifty years old. And they're temporary?
Yeah. But as long as they keep saving money for the university.... Oh, there's not near as many Quonsets as there used to be. SFU expanded a lot in the 1970s with the baby boomers, so they built a lot of new buildings then and got rid of a lot of the Quonsets. But there's still a few around, stuck in the bushes.
Like my music class here. Look at this thing: it's made of corrugated iron! The acoustics actually might be pretty good, though, with this arched roof.
What kind of music class?
Oh, it's part of my practicum. They put us right into the SFU student orchestra, and that practices here once a week.
A good thing they stuck you out in the woods here, then. You won't be bothering anyone with the noise.
Noise? We make byoo-ti-ful music!
What do you play?
French horn.
One of those, uh, curled things?
Yeah.
Well.... Anyplace else you've gotta find?
Nope. I'm ready for my first class now, I think. Sure is a big campus, though.
Yeah. We're a land grant college. The federal government gave it all this land in the beginning. And there's still a lot left that they haven't developed yet. The agriculture school uses it for pasture.
Pasture?
Sure- they've got livestock- cattle, horses, you know. SFU operates a farm right on campus. That's where the student cafeteria gets its fresh eggs every day. And some of its hamburger.
You're kidding.
Not at all. You'll see. Take a walk out to the south end of campus some Sunday. It's like a stroll in the country. It's great!- very relaxing after a tough exam.
Huh. OK, I will. Thanks. And thanks for your help finding the, the...what?
Quonset hut.
Oh yeah, 'quonset hut'.
No problem. See you around.
Deal.
Good morning, Estelle. Did you get those syllabus pages run off for me?
Omigosh! I forgot them completely! Can you hang on for just about five minutes?
Yes. No- actually, I'm glad you haven't run them off yet. I need to fix a typo in the original. I got the year wrong. This is 2009 now, isn't it? 
Yes, and it has been for the last two months. Can I change it for you?
Oh, you'd better just give me back the original, Estelle. It's wrong in a couple of places, and it would be easier if I just went over it myself, I think.
All right, then... um.... Ah! Here it is.
Good. Uh...can I borrow your white-out?
Sure. Here.
Thanks. (correcting the master copy) Is the chairman coming in this morning?
He should be in about eleven. He has a meeting with the Dean first thing before that.
About budget cuts, I'll bet.
Probably. I hope I'm not one of them.
Ah, don't you worry- you're irreplaceable. You're the heart of the department.
Well, they do successful heart transplants now.
I suppose so, but anyway, I'm sure your job is more secure than mine. Assistant professors are a dime a dozen, and one more or less is not critical to operations- but- no secretary? We'd be in chaos in a day!
Maybe.
Here you are. It'll be OK with the penned-in correction, I think. It doesn't need to be fancy. I only need ten copies for this class, and then I'll revise it again for next term anyway.
Whatever you say. I can do these in a minute. Shall I bring them down to your office?
Yes, that would be- oh. No. I have to run down to the reading room first, so I'll swing back and pick them up from you here.
OK then.
Oh, and while I'm thinking about it- have we still got some of those little A4 binders, the looseleaf ones?
Yes, some. How many do you need?
Oh, um... six, I think. I want to break my introductory course into modules.
Oh, just for you, then, not for all your students. Yes, we've got that many. What color would you like?
Color?
Yes. Blue? Navy? Pink?
Ack! Pink?!
Well, some people like it.
I suppose. Not me. I'll take navy if you've got six of them.
Just a minute...uh...four, five...yes, I do. Here you are.
Great! And, uh, the labels?
Oh, labels. Uh...here. And a couple of extras so you can make a mistake.
Me? A mistake? Not a chance.
Not a chance, eh? Got the year down pat now, have you?
OK, OK. You got me. There goes your birthday rose, though.
What?! Oh, no! You really hold a grudge, don't you?
Yeah, so watch out. And could you do just one more little thing for me?
Maay-be.
Please? Could you just let me know when the chairman comes in? I need to talk to him for a minute. Just ring me- I'll be in my office from about ten-thirty till lunch time.
Yes, of course. And I'll have your copies when you come back from the reading room.
Great, thanks. Actually, just keep them here, and I'll pick them up when I see Dr. Jewett.
OK then.
Well, hello, Jason. What are you doing sitting in here all alone?
Hi, Dr Wescott. Oh, I was just looking for a quiet place to study where there's no distractions.
Well, you found the perfect spot- my empty classroom. But I guess I'm a distraction now. I left my folder of notes in here last period. Do you mind if I...?
Oh! No, no- please go ahead, Professor.
Um. Hmm.... Ah- here it is. OK. I leave you to it.
Oh, Professor....
Yes?
Would you have a minute? Could I just ask you about the comment you wrote on my last essay?
Yes, I have a few minutes now. What did I write on it?
Well, here's the essay- "The Heights of Romanticism"- and you wrote just the word "vague!" at the top beside my grade....
Oh yes. It's an interesting topic choice, Jason, but I think that maybe you, uh, bit off more than you could chew. That title covers a lot of very major English poets!
Yeah, I guess it does, doesn't it? Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Byron. You know, I felt that way too, actually, after I got started with it. But by then I was kind of trapped.
Trapped? What do you mean?
Well, I had already started research. I'd picked out some key passages from the Prelude, from Keats's odes, et cetera. I'd already learned a good bit about their personal lives- I was, you know, committed.
Well now, listen, Jason: one of the key steps in writing an essay is choosing and defining your topic at the very beginning. If you get a feeling that the theme's too broad or too narrow, or uh, too convoluted or too, um, whatever- then cut your losses right away. Abandon it and find a fresh theme. That's rule number one.
Hmm. Yeah, I guess you're right. 
And what happened here is that you were never able to get down to brass tacks. That's why I wrote "vague"- that was my main reaction when I got done reading your paper. You're assigned three-page essays in my class, and you chose a subject fit for a book!
Well, could I ask you, could you give me an example, of how I could've narrowed this down to a manageable size? Should I have just chosen one poet, do you think?- say, Lord Byron?
Yes, that's a simple solution to the problem here. But with only three pages to work with, you could afford to narrow it even more- just look at "Don Juan" as a work, uh, symbolic of the Romantic ideal, you know.
And that would be enough?
Sure, more than enough! The narrower your topic, the more incisive you can be. You might even come up with an original idea about Byron and the Romantic Movement!
Not likely.
But see, that's wrong thinking. These essays are not just rote assignments, Jason, something you have to crank out in order to pass my course. The point is to train you to research- "re-search"- "search again"- through our literary history... and add new light on it. This is something you should be eager to do!
Yes, of course, Professor- and I am, really! But I guess sometimes they do just, well...turn into assignments. Sometimes I do forget why I' m here.
Well, you're not the only one, I can tell you that. Actually, this was one of the better essays. At least you didn't wander off topic, or just fill the three pages with polysyllabic gobbledegook. Those are the students I really come down hard on. Look, a "B minus" isn't so bad, is it?
No, I guess not. I like "A"s better, though. And that's what I'm trying for next time. Our next paper's on the 19th century up to World War One, right?
Yes, that's right.
I'm interested in the Symbolists, and I've been reading about Rimbaud- he's kind of seminal, isn't he?
He certainly is- and in a way Rimbaud is a topic already narrowed down for you. He has a very small opus- he stopped writing when he was 21 and ran off to become a trader in Africa.
Yes-- and I can identify! 
Oh, no you don't! I expect good things from you- starting with your next essay. Just remember: control your topic, don't let your topic control you. You've only got three pages, so be concise, be pithy.
OK, I'll try. Thanks very much for your time, Dr Wescott. I really appreciate it.
My pleasure, Jason. See you in class.
'Bye.
Huh! This isn't working.
What isn't?
This reaction. I'm supposed to get hydrogen gas, but I don't seem to be getting anything except air.
How are you supposed to tell?
Well, hydrogen gas should explode when I hold this burning splint up to the test tube- but... nothing happens, see?
Hmm. Very unimpressive. How do you do this experiment, again?
Well, I put some hydrochloric acid into this test tube here. And then I add a piece of zinc metal to it. A reaction takes place and hydrogen gas is produced- it says- which should come out of the glass tubing, over here, and go into this other test tube. But it doesn't.
Nothing happens?
Well, something happens. The zinc bubbles and bounces around- the acid does something to it. Some gas must be coming off, I guess, but it isn't flammable. It doesn't burn at all.
Is there any way else to identify hydrogen?
Not that I 've learned. It's completely colorless and tasteless, I know- it just burns very dramatically.
Huh. Well, I dunno. Shall we run through your experiment again together and see how it goes?
Sure, if you don't mind- that would be great! I'm sure I'm doing everything right, I've gone through it twice now, but I still get nothing, nada.
OK. Lessee.... We need what? Clean test tubes? Two of 'em? Here we are. And... a rubber stopper with ten centimeters or so of glass tubing through it... right...uh...here. That's it?
Yep. And a graduated cylinder and the Bunsen burner. And the zinc and the acid.
All right: let's do this first- let's take the zinc and the HCl from different sources- from, uh, those reagent bottles on that lab table over there. Maybe your bottles are contaminated or mislabeled or something.
Oh, good idea. Trust me to use the wrong reagents.
Just a sec.... here we are... OK, now you run the experiment like you think you should, and I'll watch what you do.
Well, first I clamp this test tube onto its stand...like this... and put in about five milliliters of the hydrochloric acid....
"About" five milliliters?! Isn't this a scientific laboratory?
All right, all right. Exactly five milliliters of HCl...like this....
OK. Mmm... and....
Then I take a little piece of zinc metal with these tweezers, like this, and-
Are they all the same size?
Yeah, they seem to be. It looks like they're pressed out of some kind of machine in standard bits.
And add "one"?
Yeah, one. Like this. And see?- it starts to bubble!
Sure does!
So I slap the stopper into the top of the test tube real quick, like- unh!- this....
Mmm....
And then, I hold the other test tube under the other end of the glass tubing, here...like this, and...uh, wait until I think I've collected enough hydrogen gas to ignite, I guess. Is the Bunsen burner going?
Yes, it's burning- and you also need a splint, right? Here's one. Hey! Just a minute- how in heck are you going to collect any gas like that?!
Like what?
Like that- holding the test tube under the mouth of the tubing
What? Am I spilling it or something?
No, no- you're losing it entirely! Hydrogen is lighter than air, Marie. It's floating UP.
Huh?
It's floating up. It's rising from the tube mouth. It's not falling into your container. Hold it above the tube!
Ack! How stupid! I am so stupid. I'm never gonna pass this course. OK, OK- now...light that for me, will you?
Right...here you go.
And.... POW! Wow, did you see that?
And we've got lift off! And you've got hydrogen. Congratulations.
Yeah. Thanks, Peter. Now all I gotta do is write this experiment up.
No problem. So, what's your next experiment?
Uh, something about sodium and water.
Oh no!
Excuse me, Mrs. Morgan?
Oh, hi...uh...Lisle, isn't it? Come in, Lisle. I haven't seen you in quite a while, have I? How can I help you?
Well...if you have a few minutes... I need you to help me sort out my credit hours. It's kind of an, uh, an emergency.
OK, sit down. I've got a few minutes right now.
Thanks very much.
So, what's the problem with your credit hours?
Well...um...I think I may not have the right ones. The ones I need to graduate, I mean.
What's your major again? Business Management?
Yeah, it's supposed to be. For Bus Ad, I still need to take Global Economics- EC 303- and, well, I've got room for it in my schedule but, erm...303's got a prerequisite, which I, uh, I haven't taken. EC 203, Econometrics.
Oh, that's just great. How did you manage that, Lisle?
Not paying attention. I didn't notice until now that I needed 303 to graduate, and didn't notice before that I needed 203 before. Is there anything I can do now to fix this?
Well, I'm not sure. It's possible that the dean would let you take them concurrently. It's been done before, in extremis.
Well, that's what I'm in- extremis. The last term before graduation and I'm stuck. Do you think he would, really?
It's possible, if your grades are good enough and everything else is in order. Are they? Is it?
Oh, yeah! My GPA's three point seven. And I've got all the other required credits, and then some- I've actually taken more electives than I need to.
Hmm. Too many electives and missed a prerequisite. Good work, Lisle.
Yeah, pretty dumb, eh?
OK, well- they're both offered this term, I hope?
Oh yes. Global Economics is Tuesday-Thursdays at three pm and Econometrics is the same days at eleven in the morning. Those would work fine, except, uh....
Except what?
Except I've already signed up for the second half of my statistics course- Stats 202- at eleven.
Is that a required course?
No, but it's highly recommended for business majors. And I really need that math. Math is my weak point, I'm afraid, and I'm going to use a lot of it if I go into finance like I want to.
Lisle, do you know what, um, Econometrics is?
Sure! Uh... I guess- what? It's, uh, "measuring economies"- "econo-" plus "-metrics"- isn't it?
It's math, Lisle. Statistics. It's a course in the kinds of statistics used in business, finance, and economics.
Oh!... Oh... so maybe I don't need Stats 202 then?
That's right. Bus Ad makes sure you get the necessary math by requiring Econometrics. But- you've taken Statistics 201 already?
Yes.
Hmm. Listen- there may be another solution to this. The dean might accept Stats 201-202 in place of Econometrics.
Really? That'd be great!
He might. Anyway, I'm going to have to call his office about this- about both possibilities- right away. Let me just see what they say. If you had a choice, which option would it be?
Uh... well, unless they really want me to take Econometrics, I think it would be easier if I completed the second half of my statistics course. I mean, then I'd have the whole course under my belt. But whatever the dean wants- I'm happy to do whatever it takes to graduate on time.
OK, good. Well, with two options, he may be more amenable to exempting you from the prerequisite. Can you bring me a copy of your transcript later today?
I've got one right here, Mrs Morgan. Here you go.
Ah. Mmm. Yes. it does look good, Lisle- three point seven and a good scattering of 'A's, too! OK. I'll arrange to see the dean as soon as I can- if not today, then tomorrow morning, I hope. And we'll try to get this straightened out for you. Stop by tomorrow afternoon about three, will you?
Sure! And thanks. Thank you very much.
OK. And don't worry too much. The dean can be quite flexible in a good cause. See you tomorrow, then.
Are you going to the job fair, Zelda?
You bet! I've gotta find work by July or August at the latest. I'm going to have no money left at all after this term. You going?
Yep. I don't really need to find a job right away- I can always part-time in my dad's shop- but I do have to get going on my career, eh? Or I'll end up in his workshop maybe forever.
What kind of business is it, anyway?
Woodworking. He makes mostly commercial stuff- store counters, shelving, barber stations, things like that, you know.
He does a good business?
Yes, actually. It's been growing recently, too. He's got three journeyman carpenters with him now. Business has been good.
You're not interested, though?
Geez...not really, no. The work's pretty boring. It's really repetitive, the same models from his catalogue over and over. I want to find something more, uh...creative, y'know.
Like what?
Oh, like something in, uh, interior design- or maybe in an architect's office or somewhere... I dunno.
Well, there oughtta be some companies like that at the fair. I know there're a couple of big construction firms coming.
Hmm. Yeah, they might have something interesting....
Still- it seems a shame, though, not to take over your father's business. Maybe you could, you know, think about expanding it, for instance. In the direction you want to go- maybe offer, um, design services? Uh, custom services?
Hmm. I probably could do that. Yeah. That might be an idea at that....
You could at least, you know, try it out, maybe this summer. If you don't find another job.
Lemme think about that. Actually, uh...erm....
What?
Actually, I'll tell you a, another reason I don't really want to work in my dad's place. It's a carpentry shop, right? With a lot of table saws and radial arm saws and band saws, you know? And, well, every carpenter there- Dad included- has a missing finger or two. Or three.
Huh?!
Yeah. The work's repetitive, like I said, eh? And if it's your job eight hours a day to run boards through a saw, and inevitably, sometimes, you lose your, uh, concentration- someone tells a joke or something, y'know- and, well...ZIP! goes your thumb through the saw with the board. Dad's missing the last two fingers of his left hand- just whacked 'em off in an instant when the phone rang once. They all try to be careful, of course, but, well, it's just, just an...occupational hazard. I work there long enough and I'm gonna lose an appendage too.
Oh wow! That's awful! I guess I wouldn't want to work there either. Ack! I can't blame you for wanting out. What's your dad think of that decision, though?
Oh, I dunno what he really thinks, but he's very supportive. He says I should follow by own path, wherever it leads. But I don't think he's really, y'know, attached to the business- it's just what he got into and what he knows how to do, and what he makes money at.
Is he going to retire?
Oh, yeah! He's looking forward to it, too. Then he can get down to this first love....
Which is...?
Toy soldiers. He makes them. He's got a whole army in our basement- Bengal Lancers, Soaves, Beefeaters, hussars, you name it!- he casts 'em in lead, paints 'em, puts 'em in little, uh, dioramas, you know what I mean? He's good at it, too.
Wow, what a gas!
Yeah. So there's no love lost between him and the workshop. He'll be glad to be done with it, I think.
OK- so you're coming to the job expo then, to find a career? When are you going?
Early, I guess. When does it open?
Nine-thirty.
That's Saturday, right?
Right. I don't suppose you've made an appointment?
Huh? No. Do we have to?
No, but it's a good idea if you know who you want to see. It's gonna be crowded at some of the booths- the ones for the prestige companies- and it makes a good impression if you've got one. Shows you're professional. Shows you're serious.
So you've got one?
Yeah, I've got appointments at ten and eleven with two engineering firms, ATC and Industrial Services.
Well. Hmm. I have no idea who to get an appointment with. I'll just have to look around when I get there, I guess.
Good planning, Walter. It's easy to see who's hungry for work here. Why don't you check the list of participants in the Counselling Office? You've still got time to make an appointment with one of them.
Ah! Yeah, OK- I'll do that. I'll go over there right now. Your enthusiasm's contagious, Zelda. Thanks.
OK- and I'll see you at the fair somewhere, I guess.
No, you'll see me before that- we've got Drafting class together tomorrow afternoon, remember? See you.
Oh, yeah. See you. Good luck.
Dr Isaacs?
Yes. Can I help you?
I'm Louise Newman. I made an appointment to see you at two? I'm sorry- I'm a few minutes early....
Ah, yes. Newman. That's fine. Come in. Sit down.
Thank you, sir.
Now- what can I do for you, Newman?
Well, uh...I was wondering if it would be possible for me to audit your Advanced Communications course, um, COM 410, next term?
Hmm. I don't generally like students auditing my classes. Why can't you enroll in it?
Because I don't have the prerequisites, Doctor.
Neither 310 nor 312?
I'm afraid not. You see, I'm not in a liberal arts program at all. I'm getting my master's in Zoology.
Zoology? Huh! Why are you interested in my course, then? It's a sociology course. We deal with the, um, phenomena of international communications.
Yes, I understand that, sir. But you see, my thesis is concerned with inter-species interactions. I'm working with Doctor Schmidt and his orangutan project. He's been working on, uh, orangutan - human communications, but my own project is orang interactions with, with other primate species.
Sounds interesting. What species?
Well, right now, I'm just looking at the, uh, potential for interactions between several different primates. Besides Dr Schmidt's orangs, the Primate Lab is keeping some chimpanzees and gibbons, and several New World monkey species. At the moment, I'm trying to find out which might offer the, you know, richest activities for examination.
And how do you suppose my Advanced Communications would be of value to you?
To be honest, Doctor Isaacs, I'm not sure. I'm hoping it will come to me during the term. At the moment, I just have a, a feeling that there's going to be some parallels between human intercultural interactions and primate interspecific interactions- and that looking at cultural, um, frictions may supply clues to what I see in my research. And, uh, vice versa, of course!
I see. Well then, why can't you enroll in 310 or 312 this next term? And then take 410 after that?
Unfortunately, I don't have any classes after this term, Professor. My final six to eight months needs to be spent on active research and my thesis preparation, and then on my orals.
Hmm. You're not making it very easy for me, you know, Newman.
I'm sorry, Professor. But I am really eager to sit in on your classes. I've heard a good deal about them.
Good things, I hope.
Oh yes sir!
 Well, have you taken any sociology-related courses at all?
Hmm. Well, uh, I've had the usual ethology classes- animal behavior classes- in the Department of Zoology, of course. And when I was a sophomore, I took World Social Systems- you know, capitalism versus communism?- which is a required undergrad course. Oh, and I took a cultural awareness course as an elective- Views of Existence, I think it's called. I found that very interesting.
Yes, that's Sociology 242. Who taught that, do you remember?
Um... Oh, yes- Doctor Wright. He was good.
Ah! Josh White- yes, he's a good man. What was your grade in 242?
Oh, I got an A. I really enjoyed that subject, and Doctor Wright's a very engaging speaker.
 Yes, he is, isn't he? Let me ask you a question. Can you define "habitus"?
"Habitus"? Uh...yes, I think so. Isn't it a word referring to the common, daily, habitual practices and assumptions that we have within a given, uh, social environment? People are at the same time the, um, creators of and the, uh, product of their habitus, I think.
Yes- that's very accurate! Well, Newman, you seem to have some familiarity with this field, and I'm certainly intrigued with how you hope to, um, apply what you may learn. I like "thinking outside of the box" very much, and you seem to be doing that. You'll be able to attend all of the classes, I presume?
Yes, I'm sure I can. Uh- they're Thursday mornings, right? At nine thirty?
Yes, that's right. And you're welcome to join in any of the questions or discussions. You won't be taking the final exam and you won't be getting any credit hours- I hope that's clear.
Yes, of course, Professor.
And you can try your hand at my little pop quizzes if you like- I'll grade them for you. One of my small pleasures in life is seeing how poorly my students understand my quiz questions. 
Oh.  Forewarned is forearmed, I guess. So I can really audit 410?
Yes, that will be fine. If you have any further questions, please feel free to come back and see me.
Thank you very much, Professor Isaacs. I really appreciate this. It is very important to me.
My pleasure, Newman. And I would like to hear how your research is going. Have a good day.
Excuse me....
Yes?
Hello. I'm, uh, I'm taking a student survey as a part of my Sociology course, and, um, I wonder if I could ask you a few questions?
Uh... well- how long will it take?
Oh, only about three minutes. Do you have time?
Hmm. Yes, I guess so. Only three minutes, eh?
Yes, and it's anonymous. I only need to ask your age, sex, and, um, university year.
OK. Sure. Go ahead.
Thanks. This is a student survey in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Sociology 117. No identifying information will be collected. This survey constitutes research data for the topic "The Relation of Student Alcohol Consumption to Student Attendance and Grade Point Average". It will take approximately three minutes to complete. My name is Nancy Puzzio. Question one: What is your age?
I'm, uh, nineteen.
And you're male.
Last time I looked, yes.
And your year at BSU?
Third year. I graduate at the end of next academic year.
Thank you. Now, the legal drinking age in this state is eighteen. Do you drink alcohol at all?
Uh, yes, I do. Sometimes.
And have you been drinking alcohol since you turned eighteen, the legal drinking age?
Yes- I started on my eighteenth birthday, as a matter of fact.
How often do you consume alcoholic beverages?
Oh, um...it's hard to say....
Do you consume some quantity every day?
Huh? Oh, no. No- maybe once or twice a week, average.
And what is your beverage of choice?
Oh, I drink beer usually. Occasionally wine. I don't like, uh, um, hard liquor.
How many pints of beer do you consume in one drinking session?
"Drinking session"? I don't get sloshed every time I drink!
No, "session" just means "occasion" or "instance"- it's a research term.
Oh, I see. Uh... two, three pints maybe.
Once or twice a week?
Yes, that's right.
And would that be on regular days- weekends, for example?
Yes, that's right. Friday night, or Saturday night. Sometimes both.
And for which of the following reasons would you say you primarily drink alcohol? A - stress. B - pleasure. C - socialization. D - habit?
Can I choose more than one?
Yes.
Then, I guess I'd say for pleasure, mostly, and to relieve, um, stress? Stress. For relaxation, really- after a week of classes and studying, it's relaxing.
Do you usually drink alone, or with others?
Oh. Sometimes alone. Usually with others- my roommate or classmates or somebody.
And- do you ever consume sufficient alcohol to feel its aftereffects the following day?
You mean, do I ever have a hangover? No... Well, very rarely. Sometimes after a party.
How often would you say you attend parties where alcoholic beverages are served?
Hmm. Maybe once in two or three months. Not often. Sometimes I get invited to a, a fraternity party or something, but not very often.
Has the consumption of alcohol ever affected your class attendance or your ability to study?
No.
Has the consumption of alcohol ever restricted your study or preparation time?
No, not really. Of course, I suppose I could be studying all Friday and Saturday nights, too. So in that, uh, sense, yes, I guess it does limit my studies in that way. But, uh, I think it's more important for good study habits to have that, er, relaxation time available, you know?
OK. Have your drinking habits or quantities changed significantly since you began drinking?
No, I don't think so. No.
And have your study habits or class attendance changed significantly during your time at BSU?
No, not really. I may be preparing a little more now. My courses are harder, and I'm more, well, concerned about grades now.
What is your current GPA?
Three point eight.
Oh! That's great! Well, thank you for your time. This is the end of the survey. If you're interested in the outcome of my research, I'll be, um, making it available to survey participants at the end of the semester. Here. This is my email address. Please email me if you'd like to get a copy of my survey results.
Yeah, I would, actually. This is kind of an interesting topic.
Thank you for participating. Have a nice day.
You, too. And good luck on your paper.
Hello, Michelle. Can I help you?
Hello, Professor. I was wondering if you had a few minutes to, uh, talk to me about my essays.
Sure. Sit down.
Thanks. Professor, you, uh, you gave me a C plus on my last essay. That's the third C you've given me now. I guess I just don't understand what it is you're looking for.
Well, you're not alone, Michelle. I'm afraid most of the class is doing poorly this term. Now, I've tried to explain what I want you all to do several times now, but nobody seems to get it. I guess I'm a failure as a teacher.
 I don't think so. But, I'm sorry- would you mind trying one more time with me? I understand that you want to see a clear, efficient development of the thesis and all that, and I thought I'd done that this time, I really did.
Have you got your paper with you?
Yes...here it is...right here.
Let me have a look.
Sure! Here.
Mmm...yes...I remember now. Actually, Michelle, you have a very good thesis here. I like it. I just wish you could've presented it more effectively.
In what, in what way?
Well...just look at your opening sentence. This is the first sentence that the reader meets. "Most authorities consider the zygote the initiation of a new existence." Now tell me, Michelle, if the average person picked this up and started reading it, would they understand that?
Well, um...I hope so. I mean, I presume so- that's what I presumed when I wrote it, of course.
Of course. It seems short and direct. But you must remember that when you wrote this, you had been reading and researching your topic beforehand- I hope- but the reader is coming to this cold. How many people know what a zygote is? How self-evident is the meaning of "a new existence"? That's a very abstract phrase.
Yeah, I guess so.
Michelle, the writer's first duty is to his readership and his second duty is to his thesis. Think of all the articles you've read that've been built on flimsy arguments, misconceptions or untruths, and yet have become widely popular, have enjoyed wide acceptance because of the writer's talent at communicating.
Yeah, there're a lot of those. You want us to write like that?
 Well, I certainly don't want you to be promulgating untruths- that's what I hope I'm helping my students avoid- but it would be worth your while to notice how some of those writers do it. The key to effective writing is "Know thy readership"- assess your reader accurately.
What they know, right?
Exactly! What they know... and what they don't know. If you talk down to them, they feel insulted. They say to themselves, "Does he think I'm stupid or something?" And they walk away.
Well, I don't think that, that's for sure.
Maybe not, but your opening sentence borders on the other extreme- if you expect too much of your readers, you'll also put them off. They'll say to themselves, "Who does he think I am, Einstein?" And again, they'll walk away.
Well, um...so, what should I do, for instance, with this first sentence here? I can't make the grammar any simpler, can I?
No, but you can certainly tone down the vocabulary. Either that or define difficult or arcane words when you use them. But that usually slows things down. Anyway, you have to bring yourself and the reader to the same level somehow- that's what you should always be shooting for.
So... I should define 'zygote' right off the bat- "...a zygote, or fertilized egg,...."
That's the idea...but keep it short, or you'll lose the effectiveness of your opening. Why not just go ahead and use 'egg'? Then you can introduce the more, uh, precise scientific term later in the paragraph.
Just "An egg is..."?
Sure. It's strong and clear, which is just what you want in order to interest your reader. You have a whole essay to be more precise in, to get down to the details.
Then what about the rest? You said that "initiation of a new existence" is too, um, too....
Too abstract. OK, just tell me thiwhat do you mean by that phrase?
Well, uh... it means, um, the start of a new life, a new living thing....
Good! Well, why didn't you say that in the first place? That's much more direct and attention-getting. It's expressed in a way that anyone can understand. "An egg is the start- or the beginning- of a new life".
But...does that sound, well...formal enough, Professor?
Don't confuse formality with obfuscation, Michelle. You don't have to write densely to be formal- and lord knows you don't have to use big words! You just need to avoid slang and, uh, casual language. And be sure that the grammar is standard. Write clearly, simply, directly- that's what makes a good essay.
OK. Maybe I've just gotten a better idea of what you're looking for now. "Clear, simple, direct." I'll remember that next time.
Good. And I'll be looking forward to how well you succeed. I'm not averse to giving A grades if they're deserved, you know.
Thanks for your time, Professor. I really appreciate your help.
Not at all, Michelle. That's what I'm hear for. See you in class.
See you.
Hi
Hi, Lil.
How was your holiday? Did you go home?
Yeah. How about you?
No! It was Spring Break- I went to Fort Lauderdale. I love it there during Spring Break.
Oh, yeah- I see you got a tan. How was it? Isn't it awful crowded there?
Yep- that's what's so great about it- it's one big crowded party. It's a blast!
Who'd you go with?
My roommate, and two other girls in the dorm. We drove down. One of them has a car. It's a real old clunker, but it got us there and back OK.
Where'd you stay? In the car? I hear rooms are impossible to get down there during Break.
No- we just found a Motel Six up the coast about twenty miles and stayed there. Then we drove down to Lauderdale in the morning and back at night. You can park anywhere along the beach. The only problem was choosing our, um, designated driver each time. Nobody wanted the job.
I guess not! What'd you do, rotate?
We tried to, but my roommate met a guy she liked, and she kind of dropped out of the schedule, you know. And then one afternoon we all got separated. When we finally met up back at the car, it was 'way past midnight, and nobody was in any condition to drive. So we just stayed there all night and danced on the beach.
Sounds like you had fun. Nobody got in trouble?
Well, we didn't. The police had their hands full, though- like they do every year, I guess. There's always somebody who ends up drunk and disorderly.
Yeah. And what about your assignment for this class? Did you get it done?
I did. I wrote it in the car on the way back yesterday.
In the car?! With three tired, sunburnt, giddy girls?
Yup. They did all the driving, and I sat in the back and wrote. That was the deal I made with my roomie- I told her I'd go if she'd promise me at least, at least two or three hours to myself to get my work done.
That was "time to yourself"?
Yeah, I had the whole back seat. 
 But what about your research, your, uh, references? I don't suppose you had a library in the back seat, did you?
 Yeah- it was a bookmobile.  No, I got an early start. I did my research before I left and then took a bunch of notes with me. And I carried along a couple of the, uh, most important reference books.
How'd your paper come out? OK?
Pretty good, if I do say so myself. I'm pretty happy with it. I had to go to the library last night to pick up a couple of missing, you know, citations, but that didn't take long. And I got it typed up and printed out this morning.
Hot off the presses, eh?
Yep. Just in time. How's yours?
Yeah, I'm happy with mine, too. I tried to get it done at home- I wasn't gallivanting around like you were- but my folks always had something they wanted me to do. Dad wanted me to come down to the shop and look at the new equipment he installed. Or, uh, Mom'd ask me to go into the garden and pick spinach or something for dinner or come with her to say "hello" to the neighbors or something.
Family can keep your hopping. Sounds about like my folks, too. I probably got more rest in Lauderdale than I would've at home.
 I don't think so!
I got my paper written, didn't I?
Yeah, OK. Point taken. And then, and then, my brother and his family showed up, and it turned into a grand reunion. So I didn't get as much done as I thought I could.
Too bad.
So then I came back here a day early and spent it in the library stacks wrapping things up. That was nice. It was real quiet around here. The stacks were empty, so I could really concentrate. Nobody to bother me.
Who'd bother you, anyway?
Well, no one to chat with, I mean. I tend to, uh, get into conversations a lot when I should be studying.
Probably an avoidance reaction.
What's that, your psychology again?
Almost. Animal behavior. We're just animals, you know, and we usually behave like them.
Yeah, social animals
I enjoyed your lecture today, Dr Beech. See you.
Goodbye. Oh- Jack?
Yes, Professor?
Have you got a minute?
Uh...sure. Have I done something?
 No, Jack. Not at all. You're doing very well indeed in my class, and, uh, I've noticed that you seem particularly interested in my research....
Thanks! Yes. It seems like fun to be working with primates. They're very likeable animals, aren't they? Very gentle, very smart.
Yes, they are, and it's nice to be able to mix business and pleasure. But they do take a lot of, well, looking after to keep them healthy and happy. I've got an assistant, Larry- you know him, I think, the student who brought Maisy and Daisy into the classroom last month?
Oh, yes, I know Larry, Larry Easton. He's getting his master's in Zoology, isn't he?
Yes, that's right. And he's graduating in June. So I was wondering if you might be, be interested in, uh, taking over for him, taking his assistantship. Um, I don't know if you want to work, or need work, of course....
Oh! Uh- yes. Yes! That's something I would really like to do, yes. Oh. But, uh....
But?
But...well, I guess I should find out a little bit more about it. I mean, the hours, the, um, time involved, and, and... can I do the work? I don't really know what all's involved.
Well- have you got a little time right now?
Uh, yes- my next class's not till one. Sure.
Good. Let's just sit down here then, shall we?
OK.
Now, it's not a very romantic job, I'm afraid, Jack. My research assistant is mostly in charge of maintaining the laboratory animals- preparing their food, cleaning their quarters, uh, feeding and watering them, of course, and, uh, just keeping an eye on things, you know- making sure they're healthy and comfortable.
How many primates do you have in the lab?
Twelve right now. There are ten bushbabies and two aye-ayes. The aye-aye pair are in one of the big cages, and the bushbabies are in the other two. One has a family in it- the mother and father and two babies- and the other group are unpaired juveniles, including Maisy and Daisy.
Ah.
Oh, and there's a smaller cage with Max, the old male I started with. He's the only one you have to be careful of.
Careful of? Why?
He bites sometimes. You can go right into the other cages, though. They're all quite friendly- sometimes too friendly.  Until you get the food set out, they'll be all over you looking for it.
Well gosh, it sounds easy enough, I suppose. I've had enough mice, hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbits over the years to know how to take care of mammals pretty well, I think. At least basically. I wanted a capuchin monkey when I was in high school, but Mother drew the line at that.
 Well, mothers can be that way. Mine still doesn't understand how her daughter can handle "wild varmints". 
 What do they eat, anyway? Fruit?
Yes, fruits, mostly- apples, grapes, pears- and also some vegetables. Lettuce, uh, carrots... we try different things sometimes. And they get mealworms for snacks. Part of your job will be to pick up the fruit and vegetables from Campus Stores- I have a standing order there- twice a week. And then you chop some of them up every morning for their rations. Larry'll show you how to do it.
And...mealworms?
Yes, we have a couple of trays of them in the lab. You'll need to tend them, too, and sift out a few dozen every day for the bushbabies. It's easy. It only takes a few minutes.
What kind of hours are we talking about, Professor? And when during the day?
Well, student assistantships are limited to fifteen hours a week- university regulations. The animals have to be tended every day, of course, but I'll be responsible for Sundays and holidays. The main thing is that you'll have to come in before classes, in the early morning, say about seven or seven-thirty, and, uh, spend an hour or an hour-and-a-half cleaning the cages- throwing out the old straw and laying down fresh straw, uh, washing the food bowls and giving them fresh water. And then preparing their food and giving it to them. It's a simple routine, really, when you get used to it.
OK.
And then, I'd like you to be sure to stop by again in the late afternoons or early evenings- sometime between, oh, four and seven?- to check them, check their water, and give them a bit more fruit and their mealworms. Would you be able to do all that?
Sure, that sounds fine. My class load's not so heavy now that I'm in third year. I'm sure I can arrange my class schedule around that. Oh. Uh...can I ask how much it, um, pays?
Oh! Sorry, Jack- of course! Fifteen dollars an hour- $225 a week. The university will withhold some for taxes and issue you a check at the end of each month. It should be for about $850, I think. But you can ask Larry.
Gee, that's fine, Dr Beech. That'll help me out a lot with my expenses. And I'm going to love getting to know your bushbabies- and aye-ayes, wow!- better. Will I have a chance, do you think, to, uh, help with your research?
Yes, there's certainly a good chance of that, yes, if you want to. I'd be happy to have you get involved. We have a lot to learn from these "varmints".
 Great!
OK then- I'll talk to Larry, and we'll see when we can get together, the three of us, and set up some time for you to start learning the routine. And I'll get the paperwork rolling tomorrow.
Thanks very much, Professor. Thank you for thinking of me.
And thank you, Jack. I know I'll be able to rely on you. Taking care of animals requires a strong sense of responsibility, and I think you've got that. Next class, we'll set up a meeting time, OK?
OK. Thanks again! See you.
See you, Jack.
Hi
Hi, David. Sit down. The last what?
My last exam. That's it for me for this term!
Lucky guy! I've still got one exam left tomorrow.
Which one?
Microeconomics. And I'm dreading it.
Yeah? How come? Couldn't be that hard for you. You're an Economics major, aren't you, Rachel?
Yeah. It shouldn't be, I know, but somehow- I'm just not getting a handle on it. Too much math, I guess. I'm more of a theoretician. 
 Yeah, you and John Maynard Keynes. Rachelian Economics- where supply and demand are not inversely related.
 Anyway, I've just barely squeaked by all of her quizzes- and I only got sixty-nine percent on the midterm.
Oy! You'd better burn some midnight oil tonight, then.
Don't worry- I'm planning to. Want coffee?
No thanks. I gotta run in a minute.
How come? I thought you were all done.
I am. I want to pick up the tickets for the Homecoming game.
Haven't you done that yet? I thought you were all gung-ho for Homecoming. I hope there're still some left.
No problem. They're already bought and paid for. I just have to pick them up at the frat house. Zeta Tau always buys a block of seats so we can 'command a presence'- and make fools of ourselves.
 Well, that should be easy.
 Yeah, our reputation's not so hot, is it? But this year's officers have been trying to untarnish our image. Get us off our slippery slope to utter degradation.
 Good luck. Gotta date?
Huh? Uh...erm...well...I just thought you, uh, would....
Come with you? And get beer and catsup splattered all over me? And get both eardrums shattered? You gotta be kidding. You're on your own for this one, David.
Aw, c'mon, Rachel. It'll be fun! I'll buy you a big chrysanthemum!
Tempting, but...no. I've gotta get packed, anyway.
Packed?
I'm going home for the break- and I leave real early the next morning.
Oh. OK. Well, I guess I'll just batch it, then. That means I can drink more and make a bigger idiot of myself without you there.
Yeah, look at it that way. How'd you do on your finals, anyway?
Oh, pretty good overall, I think. I'm not too sanguine about my chances of passing Biometrics, but the others have been fine. I should get an A in Genetics, and either As or Bs in Cell Biology and Animal Behavior. Biometrics- that's been awful. It's all statistics and probabilities and variances and things. All, um, higher math!
Ha! Well, I empathize. That's my Achilles' heel, too. Numbers just don't like me.
Or you just don't like numbers. Y'know, I actually liked arithmetic when I was little. It was so logical. And algebra, geometry- I enjoyed those. No grey areas, I guess.
You probably liked playing with your compass and protractor, didn't you?
Ha! Funny you should say that. I actually impaled myself on my compass one time- horsing around at school, and I ran it right through my finger! The school nurse had to pull it out for me. Gross!
Ack! That gives me the shivers! I didn't know mathematics could be so dangerous.
Yeah. Anyway, when I got to calculus in high school, the wheels suddenly came off. I hit a brick wall, just suddenly could not understand what in heck was going on. That's the point where math and me came to a parting of the ways.
Sounds like my story- except for the puncture wound! I guess we should just keep sharp objects out of your hands, eh?
Yeah, that would be safest. How about your finals?
Oh. Yeah, they'll be all right. Micro tomorrow is my only real worry. World Economies is good- I should ace that. And maybe ace Political Systems, too- I think Dr West likes me.
Huh?! What do you mean, "likes" you?
No, no- I just mean that he thinks I'm an eager student, so he'll give me the, the benefit of the doubt, maybe, on my final grade. If there is any. I wrote him a real nice mid-term essay.
That thing on "the joys of capitalism"?
Right.
Didn't you just copy that out of Wikipedia?
Hey, hey!- I did research, yes!- and I cited every single source, thank you!
Sure you did. Oh! Gotta go. I told them I'd be stopping by at three.
OK.
Sure you don't want to come?
I'll pass.
OK then. ...I wonder... that nice blonde in my Behavior class....
Watch your mouth, buster!
 OK, OK. Next time, then.
Maybe. Bye.
Good morning! I have an appointment at ten? My name is Sampson?
Hi, good morning! Yes, Mr Sampson, please sit down. Thank you for coming. Now: could I just get some basic information from you first, please? Your name is, uh, Garth Sampson?
Yes, that's right.
Sorry. And you're graduating this year?
Yes.
And your major is...?
Computer Science. I'll be getting my BSc in Computer Science.
Good. This May, right?
Yes, right.
And your mailing address?
That's Box 648 University Station, Vancouver V8G 2R9
...V8G 2R9... and your email and cellphone?
GSampson@coolmail.ca....
....@coolmail.ca....
...and 090-555-6269
...6269. Great! And you're a Canadian citizen?
Yes, I am.
Good. OK, that's all I really need right now. Now, you said you'll be getting your bachelor's in computer science. Why did you choose that field?
Oh, wow- I've never thought of any other career for myself. I've always been into computers, ever since I was in elementary school. My father bought me my first one, a used, uh, Apple MacIntosh, when I was eleven years old, and I've been sitting in front of a computer ever since. I, uh, got interested in how they work, you know, and, well, I kind of tore that old Mac SE apart circuit by circuit when it died.
Oh, you have good mechanical skills, then?
 No, I'm afraid not! I made a real mess of the Mac. I'm, I'm all thumbs, actually- but it satisfied my curiosity. I'm more interested in software programming now.
Well, we certainly always have a need for good programmers. What programming courses have you taken here?
Actually, I didn't, uh, start here at UBC. I transferred in from Corolla College. It's a community college. I took their two-year diploma in Computing. I had Visual Basic and Cobol there.
How were your grades?
Oh, good! Those courses were really exciting for me. I got As in both of them. And, um, then here at UBC, I've taken Oracle and C-and-C++ programming. So I think I've got a solid background in computer languages now.
Have you done much programming?
You mean outside the classes? Uh, well, no, I wouldn't say so, really. Just my class projects. My father was interested in building an oddsmaking program for horse racing, and I helped him put that together, but I've never down any real, um, commercial work of any kind.
Horse racing?  Does it work?
Well...yeah, the program runs OK. But he hasn't had much luck at the track yet. I think the problem is his input data. 
 I see. Well now, at IT Solutions, we have two divisions I think you might be interested in. Our Industrial Systems Division is doing a lot of work right now in nano-programming, with a lot of potential in, uh, medicine, and also in, um, aeronautics. They're into some real cutting-edge stuff there...
Gee, that sounds intriguing- capsule computers and all that, eh?
Yes, that's right. And our Consumer Software Division is busy now, um, trying to get the last bugs out of our new wristband cellphone. We're about ready to hit the market with it, so there's a lot of activity going on there these days.
Almost out? That's great! I've been waiting to get my hands on one of those. After all the hype, I hope we're not going to be disappointed.
 No, I guarantee you won't! It's going to be a real eye-opener. And maybe we can get you involved with the next generation.
Really? That would be something!
But what we'd like you to do first is get your transcripts sent in to us. Here- here's my card. Just have them snailed to this address and to my attention. Oh- sorry, my name's Ed Freeberg...here.
OK, sure! I'll run over to the Registrar's and have that done right away.
And then we'd like you to come in to our offices sometime in the next couple of weeks to, uh, you know, just have a look around and have a chance to talk to some of the division staff and HR people. How does that sound?
That sounds great, Mr Freeberg. Thank you.
Good! Well, uh, what would be a good day for you, do you think?
Uh...lessee... um, next Tuesday or Thursday would be real good. I've got no classes those days right now.
Ah. OK then.... how about the... fifteenth, Thursday, at, say... ten o'clock?
Thursday. Ten a.m. Yes, that's fine.
And if you will just come to the Main Reception- here, at this address- and ask for me, that's Ed Freeberg- they'll let me know you're there, and I'll come down and get you.
OK, great! I'll be there. Thank you very much.
And thanks for coming in to see us. You may have a great future with IT Solutions.
I hope so!  Thank you.
See you next Thursday, then. Goodbye.
Good morning, Ms. Rosencrantz. You're here to discuss your essay? What's the problem, is your grade too high? 
Uh yes sir. I mean no, my grade's not too high. It's, um, I was just, um, wondering...I got a B minus, and I was, I just wanted to ask why. I worked really hard on it, and I thought I'd get a, a higher grade.
I understand. And I know you worked hard on it. I could tell when I read it that you put a lot of effort into it. Sloth is a problem for some students, but not for you. Unfortunately, hard work doesn't always translate into a high mark. But, remember, a B is a pretty good grade, no?
I know, it is. But I get mostly B-plusses and A's. So, um...could you please tell me what's wrong with it, and how I can [false start] how I can improve for next time.
Absolutely. Do you have the essay with you? Let me see it (rustling paper). Well, first of all, it's creative and well written; er, I mean grammatically, there aren't many mistakes. Your thesis sentence is clearly stated, and it's in the first paragraph. Good, good. I think your greatest weakness is structure. You need to make sure that your supporting paragraphs reinforce your thesis.
Yes, I know. I tried to outline it before I wrote, and then, uh, you know, follow the outline as I wrote it. But it got kind of hard to stick to the outline.
An outline is an excellent tool. Um, the trouble with outlines sometimes is that as you write, your ideas change. Something comes to you that you didn't think of when you made your outline, or you get busy writing and find you've strayed from the outline structure. So you need to be careful not to follow your outline too rigidly. It's only a guide.
Yeah, I found that out in the third paragraph, 'cause I wanted to add some of the stuff we learned about the Renaissance. So then I went back and changed the outline, and uh, it, kind of uh...it was hard to figure out how to include all that.
That confusion shows in your paper. Remember that each sentence -- I mean paragraph -- needs to have a topic sentence, then other sentences that support it. In your third and fourth paragraphs, this doesn't seem to be the case. Here, take a look.
Oh, I see. The topic sentence mentioned changes in art, and then I started writing about changes in religion and science.
Yes, it would have been stronger to treat each of these topics with a separate paragraph. Because you strayed off track in the middle paragraphs, it took some of the punch away from your conclusion. You want to end with a bang, not a whimper. Um, another thing that lowered your mark was your bibliography section. It doesn't follow the format on the handout I gave you. Your references should be in the order they are cited in the essay. Here you list a reference that appears on page three before you list one that you cited on page two.
Oh yeah, shoot. Sorry about that.
You don't need to apologize. Just learn from your mistakes and do it correctly next time.
Yes, sir. Thank you for your help.
I'll tell you what, Ms. Rosencrantz. I wish more students were like you. You're the only one, in a class of 30, that cared enough to meet with me and challenge your grade. Congratulations! Just because you had the fortitude to do that, I'm going to change your mark from a B-minus to a B-plus.
Really! Oh thank you professor Ammons. Really, you uh, wow! That's great!
Good morning, Ms. Rosencrantz. You're here to discuss your essay? What's the problem, is your grade too high?

Really! Oh thank you professor Ammons. Really, you uh, wow! That's great!
Hi, Ms. Quinn. Come in, please. Sit down. How are you today?
I'm OK. How are you?
I'm well, thanks. And thank you for coming in. I'll try not to take too much of your time.
Oh, that's OK. Uh, thanks. Why, uh, why did you, um...
It's OK. I won't bite. I need to talk with you for a few minutes about the paper you submitted last week on bull sharks.
Uh, all right. Is there, um, something wrong with it?
Well, yes and no. First, it was well-researched, and I can tell you put a lot of time in on it. This part, for example, is informative and well-written: "They are found cruising the shallow, warm waters of all the world's oceans. Fast, agile predators, they will eat almost anything they see, including fish, dolphins, and even other sharks. Humans are not, per se, on their menus. However, they frequent the turbid waters of estuaries and bays, and often attack people inadvertently or out of curiosity."
Uh, thank you. I have a feeling there's a BUT coming...
There is. The "but" is....this wording comes straight from an Internet web site. So does the wording of several other paragraphs in your paper. Oh, don't be surprised. We professors have ways of checking papers against the Web. There's a computer program that alerts us if something in a student's paper matches something on a web site. In this case, the alarm bells were blaring.
I know. Um, sorry...I thought you said we could use the Internet to do research for the paper. That website helped me a lot, gave me lots of information.
And it was good information, Ms. Quinn. You are allowed to use that information. The problem is, you can't simply copy it word-for-word and submit it as your own work. That's called plagiarism. It's a serious crime. In fact, it sometimes causes students to get expelled from universities.
I, uh, didn't mean...I guess, I mean, I was pressed for time, and uh...
It's OK, settle down. You're not going to get expelled. When we're in a hurry, we're all tempted to take shortcuts. The good news is, your whole paper doesn't seem to be copied, so I can tell you didn't simply lift it verbatim off the Internet. In fact, much of it is your own work. Do you know what paraphrasing is?
Yeah, it's when you say, or um write, what somebody else has said, but you say it in your own words.
Correct. It's perfectly fine to paraphrase information that you find online, or in books or magazines. It's [false start] but it's not OK to quote others' work directly in your paper, unless you, uh, credit the original source. Do you understand?
Yes. I'm sorry. Will this affect my grade?
I'll tell you what. I've highlighted the suspicious paragraphs in your paper. Let's do this. Take your paper home now, re-write all the highlighted paragraphs as paraphrases, and re-submit it a week from today. Then I'll grade it based on your revisions. Is that fair?
Yes sir. Thank you. I'll have it back to you next week, no problem!
Oh, hello, Frank. Have a break, do you?
Hello, Charlie. Yes. It's been a long morning. A lecture and a lab. So I thought I deserved a cappuccino. Or- what's that?
This? It's a macchiato.
A what?
A macchiato. It's stronger than a cappuccino, not as strong as an espresso. The Golden Mean.
Oh. Perhaps I'll try one of those, then. Which buttons do I push?
Haven't you got the hang of this machine yet? Let me do it for you. Here- just push the one that says 'macchiato', and the machine'll do the rest.
Oh.... Ah, you're a mechanical genius, Frank.
 No, you're just mechanically challenged.
Maybe. I tell my wife that, anyway. Every time she asks me to fix something around the house. It doesn't work very well, though. There we are. (He takes his coffee.)
What do you think?
Mmm. Pretty good. Needs sugar, though. How are you plans for your sabbatical coming? When is it you leave, again?
July first. I've got to get set up on the coast as soon as possible. Migration will be underway. Some juveniles will've already left the Arctic breeding grounds by late June.
Got everything you need?
I've made all the arrangements, yes. That's no problem. I've got my flight booked, and I found an inexpensive summer cottage right on the flats.
And 'inexpensive' means...?
It's only two hundred bucks a week.
On the beach? At Cape Cod? That's fantastic- how'd you manage that?
Easy- I booked it through October, and they gave me a deal. October's way past the tourist season.
Great!
And I've got my own gear ready to go, of course- boots and rain gear and waterproof camera and waterproof pens. 
 Expecting some wet weather?
Bound to be some. But I'm still waiting for the stuff I ordered from Scientific Supply, the stuff that's critical.
What's that, leg rings?
Yes, leg bands, crimpers- I broke my old ones- and my new mist nets. Without them, there's no point in going- I can't catch anything...except a cold.
Got your permit?
Oh, mine's good for five more years yet there in Massachusetts.
Did you contact Scientific?
Yes. They shipped last week, but still no sign. I'm getting worried. I really can't delay my departure. I've got to ring for the whole season if I want to get a, a large enough sample size to be statistically, uh, significant.
The whole migration season?
That's right. Shorebird numbers have been very low over the past ten or so years- and they're getting lower . I'll be lucky if I can net as many as a thousand or so birds altogether- and that's for all species. As it is, the only ones that should show up in significant numbers are dunlin and sanderlings.
Why are the, the numbers down?
Well, that's what we're trying to figure out.
Global warming?
Some ornithologists think so. The warming Arctic is affecting breeding success. Others say it's loss of feeding habitat along the migration routes. Land fills continue to devour the reed beds and mudflats all along the coast, Maine to Florida. It's awful, Frank.
They both sound like reasonable causes. Maybe a combination of both?
Probably. To say nothing of the hungry South Americans who eat these guys.
What? Seriously?
Well, yes- shorebirds are a delicacy where they winter. Ironic, isn't it?- they fly south to avoid freezing to death, and they get cooked instead. Out of the frying pan and into the fire. But I don't think that's a major cause, really. Environmental awarenesss is seeping southward. So I think that's a lessening problem.
Well, I hope you get some answers this fall.
We'll get started at it, anyway. I'm recording body weight, and we should start getting some returns on the leg bands in, oh, December or January, I think.
If your nets arrive.
Yes, if my equipment arrives. As a matter of fact, I've got to run. I want to stop by the campus post office once more before my next class, just to see if it's come in.
Won't they ring you when it arrives?
Not the US Postal Service! I should've asked them to send it UPS. Save a nickel, spend a dollar. I should've learned that by now.
Well, with the budgets they give us on these grants, we kind of get stuck in that mindset, don't we?
I have, anyway, I guess. Talk to you later, Charlie.
OK. Good luck, Frank.
Oh, good morning, Sarah. Could I speak to you for a moment, please?
Uh, sure, Mrs Miller. Just let me stick these groceries inside my door, will you?
Of course, dear.
Mmm...ah...there. Now- what can I do for you?
Come on in. Sit down.
Thanks.
Just over here is fine. Yes. Just shopping?
Ah. Yes. The supermarket was crowded this morning. It always is Sunday. I should have learned that by now. Is there a problem?
Hum. Well, sort of, I think. I understand there's been some hazing going on.
Oh.  Yes, there has. Everybody's restless before the end of the term, and...you know....
Yes, I'm afraid I do. Listen- a little fooling around is all right. It's just natural for you girls to let off a little steam now and then. But we don't want it to get out of hand.
No, of course not.
I heard that there's been some tears over this.
Yeah. Martha was a little upset last night. She thinks everyone is bullying her.
Are they?
No, not really. It's just that Martha's so easy to tease, I guess.
Yes, I imagine she is. She doesn't have much self-confidence. Did you know that she's having a hard time keeping up her grades this term?
What? Really? I thought she was very smart. Everybody thinks she's kind of an egghead.
Well, that's not a very nice word, but you're right- Martha is a very intelligent young lady. But she's had some personal problems recently, and they've been getting her down.
What problems?
Well, her father passed away a couple of months ago. She's still having trouble accepting his death, and what's more, she's worried about whether she can stay in school now, or whether she should forget about school now and, uh, help support her family.
Oh...gosh.
Yes. She's worried about money, and she's worried about her, uh, responsibility to her mother. She doesn't know if she can afford to continue here.
Gee- none of us knew that. She doesn't talk much, you know.
That's why I wanted to let you know. It's really private information, and maybe I shouldn't've told you, but I thought, well, maybe a word to the wise, you know, would be sufficient. You're kind of a, a social leader here, Sarah, so I thought you might- you know- spread the word. Discreetly, of course.
Yes, yes- of course, Mrs Miller. I'll mention it to the others as soon as I get a chance to.
Thank you. I know they mean no real harm, but-
No, they don't. But sometimes we can be a little thoughtless, I guess. Is there anything we can do, do you think, to help Martha?
You mean about her schooling? Well, um, I hadn't thought about that, really. There might be.
I mean, maybe we could raise some money for her somehow. Oh, uh, have a sale or a benefit, or, um, find her a scholarship or something.
Well now, that's a nice idea, Sarah! She has only one year left to graduate, doesn't she?
Yes, that's right- so we only have to come up with about five thousand dollars or so, maybe.
Ye...es- but we really ought to talk to her about this first. I don't know what she might think about that. Martha has to make her own decisions about what she wants to do with her life. She may have decided that she wants to quit school and go to work anyway.
But that would be such a shame, after she's, she's come so far! And she's so bright! It would be a real waste for her to quit now.
Well, you'd better talk to her about that.
OK, I will- and straight away. Do you know if she's in now?
I don't think so, dear. I saw her earlier and she was on her way out. She said she had some business to take care of- at the post office, I think she said.
Well, that shouldn't take too long. Maybe she's back by now. I'll go and check, anyway. After I stop by a couple of other rooms, that is.
Thanks for your help with this, Sarah. You know, I'm really going to miss you when you graduate. You've been a fine role model while you've been here- the girls all really respect you- and you've certainly been a lot of help to me.
Oh, Mrs Miller, it's nothing, really. My mom just raised me right, I guess!
She sure did, honey. Listen- after you talk to Martha and the other girls, could you stop back by and kind of, um, fill me in? Just so I know where everything stands.
Sure thing, Mrs Miller. I've just got to put my groceries away. Then I'll get going on this.
And I'll think some more about how we might be able to give Martha a hand- or at least some moral support.
That'd be great. And so will I. Yes, the least we can do is be kinder and more attentive to her. See you in, um...a couple of hours, maybe?
OK, dear- and good luck!
Bye.
Hi, how can I help you today?
I'd like to get a work-study job, so I can start paying off my student loan.
Wonderful! How much time do you have each week to work?
Um, I'm not sure. Maybe 10 to 20 hours...
Twenty hours? That's a lot, young lady. What class are you? And how many credits are you taking this term?
I'm a freshman, and I've got 15 credits.
In that case, I'd advise you to take baby steps while you get used to university life. Fifteen credits is a pretty full load. You've got to learn how to balance your study, work and leisure time. It's not easy.
Well, I, uh, I need money pretty badly. My parents are retired, so it was tough to find a bank that would loan us money. I don't mind working hard.
[chuckles] I'm sure you don't. But it's just as important to work smart. If you don't allow enough time to study, your grades are going to suffer. And if you don't allow enough time for social life, you're going to be pretty unhappy. Plus, you've gotta leave some time just for you -- to relax, have a date, work out, or, uh, whatever. As they say, "All work and no play makes Jill a dull girl!"
Yeah, that makes sense. OK. So...what do you recommend? Is there a job I can do?
Oh, we've got plenty of jobs that need doing. The trick is to find just the right one for you. Now, I would suggest something that's about six hours a week to start with. That's, say, two hours a night, three nights a week. The other thing I recommend is to get something that gives you time to study while you're working. That way you can kill two birds with one stone. Sound OK?
Yeah, that sounds great. Like, what kind of job lets me study while I work?
How about something in the library? Usually it's just assisting students with finding something. That only takes a couple of minutes. In between students, you can study. And it's a quiet environment.
OK. How much does it pay?
It pays $20 an hour, but half of that goes toward your loan. That's what this program is all about -- helping you start to pay off your debt. So if you work six hours a week, you'll pocket $60, minus taxes. It won't make you rich, but it does give you some weekend cash.
All right. Um, the library sounds fine, but could check out some other jobs before I decide?
Hi, Hillary. Can I join you?
Oh-- hi, Bill. Sure. Sit down. What's for lunch? Oh...you're having the beef curry, eh? I'd better warn the rest of the class.
I can't come today. I've got to skip it.
Why?
Oh, I've got to finish this motivation letter here.
Which one's that?
It's my letter for USC grad school. I've got to get it in the mail this afternoon. I've been putting it off and putting it off, but now I've really got to get it done, or I'll miss the submission deadline. So I'm going to have to miss 360 class, that's all.
Too bad. Why'n't you write it before, anyway? You're one of the most organized guys I know.
Oh, I dunno. I never do know what to say in these things exactly. And this one's really got me stumped. I really want to get into their graduate International Affairs program-- so this one's got to be just right, you know?
So...what's wrong with it? Can I see what you've got so far?
Huh? Oh. Sure. Here you go. It's just that, uh, I can't find that, you know, balance between eagerness and uh, effusiveness. I mean, how to show them I'm sincere. I want to tell them that I really want to get into that program, and that I think I've got the background to do well in it-- but I can't sound like some, well, wet-behind-the-ears, stars-in-my-eyes wannabe, either.
Yeah. I know what you mean. It's hard, isn't it? It's a fine line to walk. Lemmee see...mmm...this is nice-- "The political turmoil that has brought in the 21st century"...catchy! Hmm... Oh, but this-- "I really feel my qualifications..." Naw, that's no good, Bill. That sounds really canned. And you shouldn't have to say you "feel"-- that feeling should come out in the context-- and "really" certainly doesn't belong anywhere near a formal letter!
Oh.
Just cut that clause out and get right into it: "My qualifications match the prerequisites you indicate and...". Hmm. But then you don't mention them at all.
Mention what? The prerequisites?
Neither one. You haven't given any details either about your qualifications or about the prerequisites that USC wants.
Well, they know their own prerequisites, don't they?
Yes, of course-- but a smart applicant would remind them.
And my CV is going to be attached to this-- and it lists all my education and experience-- in gory detail.
Yeah, but even so-- you ought to give them, maybe, some examples at least, some key examples, here in the letter. If you say they match, then you should match them up right here. You know, like...uh, what?-- you've taken a heckuva lot of languages, haven't you? What are you taking this year?
Uh...second year German and first year Japanese.
Well, put those in here. Be specific. "My language credits in French, German and Japanese, in addition to the fact that I am bilingual in Spanish and English, abundantly satisfy your language prerequisite." You've got to impress them with the truth, Bill, really. And nothing sounds more truthful than specific details-- details that can be checked and verified. And then, help them, help them think it out-- "My language experience has already provided me a good grounding in many cross-cultural basics."-- something like that.
But isn't all that going to make this thing 'way too long? I've always read you're not supposed to go over one, a single, page with a cover letter.
But this isn't a cover letter. Well, yes, it's a kind of a cover letter-- but it's more than that. It's supposed to show what makes you tick-- who you are, and what you want out of life. What you want out of that USC program.
So...
So don't worry about length. As long as you're not just creating padding, not creating filler, as long as you're giving them good solid useful information about your abilities and goals, they'll keep reading. And they'll get a good clear picture of who you are as a candidate.
So, what do you think then? Two pages?
Sure, that'll be fine. As long as you have something relevant to say.
But I'm running out of time on this.
Look-- isn't this important? You can do this.
Well, OK then. Whatever you say. Uh-- would you have a chance to take one more look at this thing before I send it off?
Yeah, I guess so. When? I thought you were in a rush to get this off.
Yeah, I am. But I think I can get this revised and ready by the end of our 360 lecture...
-- the one you're skipping?
Yes. So I could bring it over to you at the end of class.
Or-- where are you going to work on it? Here?
Yep. I'm going to be sitting right here till it's done.
Well then, why don't I just come back here after class and find you?
That'd be great, Hillary. I'd really appreciate it.
No problem. Anything to get you out of here and into another university. 
Aw, c'mon! Anyway, thanks. Really.
See you in a couple of hours, then.
You wanted to see me, Dr. Dietz?
Yes. Sit down please, Jacob. It's about your essay...um...just a moment. Where did I put it now? Ah, here it is. It's about your essay here...
Oh?
I'm interested in this part...uh...here: "Exiles is a play worthy of examination but not of performance. Joyce's sense of the dramatic is not so much turgid as it is unspeakable." That's an acute assessment, I think, Jacob, and very well phrased. I like it. How did you come up with that idea?
Ah. Well...uh...I dunno...I was reading a lot. I mean, I was researching my topic, and...um...I guess it just came to me, you know, after studying so much about Joyce and his about play.
And you've read Exiles, have you?
Well...erm...not all of it, actually. I, I didn't have time, really, to read the whole thing, but I, uh, I got through Act One, and then I, um, sort of skimmed through the rest, I guess...and the ending...
But you feel that you got a good sense of the play's merits and demerits?--
Umm...
-- Enough to form this considered opinion, did you?
Uh, yes, I think so, I mean...
Because what I'm wondering about here is your word choices, really. I think the opinion itself is quite good, quite perceptive. But, well, the phrasing seems a bit, a little...familiar to me. "Not so much turgid as it is unspeakable." It seems familiar. It rings a bell, you know?
Oh.
Is it possible, do you think, that you've written that before? In one of your other papers for me, I mean?
Uh...well, maybe I--
But I don't think we've discussed any other turgid authors, have we? Nice, but not a very generally useful phrase, is it?
No. I guess--
But catchy, certainly! I don't suppose you, um, caught it from someone else, did you?
No-o! Oh...well, maybe I...
Perhaps you could've read it somewhere in the course of your research? And then, well... forgotten, huh?
Um...yes. I guess I could have. But--
That sometimes happens, Jacob.
It does? Really?
Yes, it happens to the best of us, to the most conscientious of us. Reading over and over, searching through lots of references, taking notes. Phrases, ideas get picked up and we don't really realize it. They sometimes seem like new ideas we have ourselves.
I see.
Or sometimes we note down an extended quote that we like, and then we work relevant parts of it into our paper. And then we revise and we re-organize, and it just sort of, well, gets lost in the shuffle-- we just forget to, or we fail to, follow through with the footnotes, you know.
Mm...yeah. Uh--
Anyway, whatever might have happened here-- as I said, "not so much turgid as it is unspeakable"-- this sounds very familiar, like someone's said it before. And if that's actually the case, then it should be presented in your essay as a quotation, with a proper citation, don't you think? Even if the source itself is listed in your bibliography, you know.
Yes, of course! I'm sorry. Maybe I should--?
Well, you should go back to the library, go back to your reference books, and see if you can't locate the source for this remark. So-- here. Here's your essay back--
Oh!
-- and you can add the citation if you find the quote. And then, bring it back to me and I'll grade it.
Oh, OK! Thank you, Dr Dietz. I'll do that right away-- and I'll be more careful next time, I assure you.
I know you will, Jacob, I'm sure you will. And you might try looking first in Reverend Stanton's Life of James Joyce. I think that's a likely location. Isn't that one of the books in your bibliography?
I think, uh...yes, here it is. Gee, I looked at so many biographies of Joyce, I can't remember which one's which anymore.
Well, Stanton's is probably the least sympathetic of Joyce's biographers. I doubt he even tried to read Finnegans Wake. Probably thought it was nonsense.
Well, I can see why! (Laughs nervously then suddenly stops.) But I guess I'd better get over to the library now.
Yes. Yes, you should. And get back to me with your revisions as soon as you can, Jacob.
Eric! Eric! Wait up a minute! Hey!
Huh? What? Oh-- hi, Pam. What's up? You OK?
Yeah...whoosh!...yeah...I've just been trying to catch up to you for the last block. Boy, you walk fast!
Sorry. I'm running late, that's all. Can you walk and talk at the same time? What's on your mind?
Woosh... Ah...mmm...Have you got any money? Have you got any extra money?
Huh? Sure. How much do you need? Ten, twenty bucks? What'd you do, go over budget again this month?
No, no! I'm not out of pocket, no. Have you got any real money? I've been working on my practicum for Financial Management, you know, and--
Oh, that! Yeah. Mm-- you picked what?-- cash management, didn't you? How's that going?
Oh, it's going great, Eric, real great. That's what I want to tell you about. I'm supposed to work with the 200-dollar limit that Dr Geitner set us, and I think I can do pretty good for CBA Company.
CBA Company?
Yeah, I thought that was more interesting than "ABC Company".
Oh. Real catchy, yep. Very imaginative, Pamela.
Thanks! Anyway, the 200 dollars I'm using as CBA's minimum cash-on-hand, and I want to start investing it in overnights.
Overnights? Those are short-term deposits, right?
Right. You make the deposit at 6 pm and then it matures at 6 am the next morning-- it's a half-day term deposit. It doesn't earn much interest, of course, but the security and liquidity are 100 percent, and the principal and interest are fully guaranteed. And you make a little money on your money that's not doing anything at night anyway.
"Little" is the operative word there, isn't it? What do you make on 200 dollars then, Pam?
About zero point one oh percent. Twenty cents.
Wow! You'll be rich as Croesus!
No-- now wait a minute, Eric-- listen now. This is just a practicum. Real businesses do this-- big corporations do this-- and they've got maybe three or four million dollars in cash lying around at the end of every workday. Try four million dollars at zero point one percent...
...Which gives us, uh...how much then?
Four thousand dollars.
Four grand?! That's more like it. Overnights are beginning to sound all right. I wish I had a million to invest.
Me too. And y'see, that's where my problem comes. This is a practicum, not theoretical research, so I've got to actually invest that 200 dollars. The catch is that overnights, they need a minimum principle of two thousand dollars. They won't accept my two hundred.
Oh. So?
So...I was thinking. I've got a little over fifteen hundred in the bank-- that's what the two hundred is coming out of. So, if I could come up with another 500 dollars somewhere...so that I'd have the minimum... And that's when I thought of you!
Huh?! Oh-- I get it. You want me to lend you the 500 dollars. I see.
Yes. Could you, Eric?
Overnight? For one day?
Well...um..no. I'd need it for about ten days. I'm going to have to roll it over through several overnights, so I can collect enough data on the earnings and everything, but--
It's really risk-free, Pam?
Absolutely, Eric, absolutely! Is City Bank going to go bankrupt overnight? Or in ten days? I doubt it.
Well then...what about the interest?
Huh? What do you mean?
The interest we earn. On 2000 dollars, that should be about...two bucks, right? We split that, right?
Well actually, since I'll be rolling over the principal about ten times, we should make about 20 dollars, and...and-- we'll share the profits, sure. Your 500 dollars and my fifteen hundred...that would give you, lessee...um, 25 percent of 20 dollars is five dollars interest on your 500-dollar loan. Not bad, huh?
I guess I won't get rich, but-- OK. It's a deal. When do you need the money?
Well, as soon as you can, I guess.
Let's see now...Can I write you a check?
Sure.
Then I'll write you a check in class. Now let's go or we'll be late.
Excuse me...
Yes?
I'm sorry, but you can't drink coffee in here.
Huh? Wha...why?
I'm sorry, but food and beverages can't be consumed in the university libraries at any time.
Why? It's not hurting anybody...
No, but it might hurt the books. There's always the danger that you might spill it on library materials.
But-- I'm not using any library materials. I'm just uh, studying my class notes and uh, writing this paper. How could I spill coffee on any library stuff?
Another student could easily sit down here and start working next to you. Or someone passing could just knock your cup over onto themselves. Accidents do happen.
But I'm being careful. I'll set it over here, see? And keep to myself-- and not use any "library materials", OK?
Look, many people here are using our books and other materials. We cannot monitor each person's activity all the time they're here. That's why we just don't permit drinks in the library. I'm afraid that you'll just have to take it outside.
But look-- it's got a screw cap on it. With just this little drinking slot-- and the slot has a cover, too, see? I couldn't possibly spill this if I tried. Watch this!-- (The student knocks over the coffee container.)
OH! Oh, for heaven's-- Don't do that again! Look. I don't have time to discuss this with you any further. You'll have to take your coffee outside, or you'll have to dispose of it immediately-- or you'll have to leave the library. Is that clear?
OK, OK. So, I guess we live in a police state on this campus, eh? Geez! And I thought universities were supposed to be bastions of liberalism! Guess not!!...
Please keep your voice down. Others are trying to study. Young man, you're confusing liberalism with licentiousness. This is a simple rule. It is not onerous or inhumane. It's just a practical regulation to make sure that the library collections-- and many of our volumes are unique and irreplaceable-- to make sure that they are kept safely and remain accessible to students now and into the future-- that they will still be a resource for your own children, when they attend USC, maybe.
But if I'm not doing anything--
The possibility remains. Accidents happen. It's practically impossible to keep an eye on each person individually in here-- and if we could, then you'd really have a police state, wouldn't you? Ours are simple, minimal preventive regulations that all libraries institute, not just ours. Keeping our voices lowered and refraining from eating and drinking and smoking-- these are common courtesies that we should extend to each other, as well as safety measures. They're no great burden on your freedom. They're just social tools to grease the system, and help it run smoothly for everyone-- not just those who are more attentive to their own personal comforts.
OK. You win. So. Where can I go and finish my coffee in peace?
Mmm. You can take it to the student lounge in the Student Union, of course. Or you could go drink it next door in the Architecture Building lobby-- they've got some benches in there. Or-- it's a nice day. Why don't you finish it out in the quad?
We can't smoke in the student lounge anymore. Can we smoke in the Architecture lobby?
Mmm. I don't know. No, I don't think so. There are almost no smoking places on campus anymore.
Boy, don't I know it! I've really gotta quit soon. OK, I guess it's the grass, then. I'll take this out on the quad. Can I leave my notes and stuff here?
I don't think that's a very good idea. Somebody might take them.
Naw. There's nothing anybody'd want.
Well, it's up to you then.
OK, thanks. See you.
Wait a minute-- what about your bag?
Huh? Oh. Yeah. I'd better take that. It's got my lunch in it.
Your lunch?
Yes. Oh-- OK, I'll eat that outside in the quad now, too, don't worry. 'Bye.
Oh-- hi, Bill. Thanks for coming in today. I know it's supposed to be your day off.
Good morning. No, no, that's fine, Jason. I had to come in today anyway, and start the inventory of the equipment room. It's that time of year again.
Ah yes. Fiscal year end. Time to use up our budget quick before they take it away from us. How are we, generally, for supplies?
Not bad, not bad. We'll make it to the end of term all right. But we need to look at next term's projected enrollment again-- it takes time to get some of that stuff. We had trouble last time with the frogs.
The frogs? Why? We've had frogs for the last thirty years. Hell, I had frogs when I was in high school, back in the Middle Ages!
Oh, it's the amphibian fungus, Jason. You've read about it, I'm sure. The chytrid fungus. Frogs and salamanders all over the world are disappearing-- populations just decimated. And the frog farms have been hit, too.
Ah, that's right-- the chytrid fungus. Yes, it's awful. I can't help thinking that somehow the fungus is our fault, too-- along with everything else we've done to screw up the environment.
Maybe. You may be right. They say that global warming helps it spread, anyway. But the researchers don't have a handle on it yet-- they don't know where it comes from, how it spreads. It just suddenly appears in a region and wipes out most or all of the frogs and toads and salamanders there.
Wish it'd come to Australia. Do in all those damn Cane Toads. Knowing them though-- they're probably immune!
Yeah. Anyway, I'm not sure how many frogs we can get, or how much they're going to cost.
It's been one per student up till now, hasn't it?
Yes.
Well, we'll just have to get them to work in pairs from now on, that's all. That's what we did when we were in school, remember?
Uh...yes, that'll be OK, I guess. Oh! How about their illustrations, though?
Their illustrations?
Yes, their drawings. One of your assignments is a detailed illustration of one of the frog's organ systems. 'Drawn from life', remember? They spend a lot of time on that. I mean, the good students do, at least. I don't think both members of a pair can work on that at the same time.
Why not?
It's a physical impossibility. They have to evert the system-- spread the animal's organs out-- while they're drawing. If they choose different systems, then...
Huh? Oh, I see. Well then, we'll just have each pair illustrate the same system. They'll have to decide together which one. A little extra exercise in human relationships-- just what some of those budding biologists need. 
Yes, you're right there. OK then, that'll be a help. I'll get back to you with the inventory list and any other problems we've got as soon as I can. Maybe early next week?
That'll be fine. The departmental budgetary committee doesn't meet till the end of the month... But I'm still thinking about frogs. Did you see where some university or institute is trying to build up a collection of amphibians to keep and breed in total isolation? Somewhere where the fungus can be totally excluded. A kind of Noah's Ark of amphibians. Have you heard about that? You think that could work?
Oh. Uh, yes-- in Costa Rica, I think. Yes. Maybe an independent biological research center. I don't know if that will work or not. Worked for Noah, though. We'll just have to wait and see. And hope.
And hope. Yes, indeed.
But what is it you wanted us to talk about this morning?
Oh, yes--sorry. What I wanted to do this morning was go over the syllabus for Zoology 210 with you. I want to make some changes to it, but I don't want to catch you by surprise, and I need your input.
It doesn't require more frogs, does it?
No. But I don't think we've got enough time now to get into it. I've got a student consultation coming up. Could you possibly come back by after you finish in the equipment room?
Uh, sure. About four?
Sure, that'll be good. I'll be here. Thanks much, Bill
OK, see you later.
Hi. Can I help you?
Yeah. Hi. I'm, I'm not feeling very good. I think I might've caught the flu or something.
Oh, OK. I think the doctor can see you in just a few minutes.
Thank you.
And could you just sit down here and fill out this form, please? Just fill out this section, here, and down here, where the stars are.
Yes, OK. Have you got a pen?
Oh, yes. Sorry. Here you are.
OK...umm...and...oh. I don't have my student card with me. I can't remember my student number... seven...seven three...um.
Oh. Well...uh, have you been here before?
Um, yes. Yes, I have, actually. Last summer. I had poison ivy.  In June.
Poison ivy? Oh dear! In June...You should have a file here already. Your name is...?
Stephens. Shirley Stephens.
OK, just a minute, Shirley. I'll see if I can find your file. That's 'Stevens' with a 'V'?
No, with a 'PH'. S-T-E-P-H-E-N-S.
OK. Um...'R'...'S'...'Stafford'...'Stephens'. Here it is. Let's see...Poison ivy rash...You were here on June 17th, and you saw Dr. Hemmings. And your student number is...7364-UC 12.
...Mmm...U - C - 12. And um...this is May 20th?
Yes, the 20th.
OK. Um... OK. There you are. I guess I've...
Yes, OK. That's good. Now, uh...in the last six months have you-- been hospitalized for any illness?
No.
Have you visited any foreign countries or received any immunizations?
No. Oh, yes. I drove to Vancouver for a couple of days last Easter. Does that count? No immunizations, though.
No, that's OK. Are you currently taking any medications?
No. Are vitamins medications? And glucosamine? I take those every day.
Glucosamine? Why are you taking that?
Oh, the trainer suggested it to me.
Trainer?
Uh-huh. At the gym. I go to the campus sports centre three times a week
Oh. Good for you. But-- ?
But-- so, maybe I've been training too hard. My ankles and wrists kind of...ached. So the trainer suggested I try glucosamine. She said it was mild, that it was harmless, but it might help a bit.
Ah.
Was she wrong?
Oh, probably not. Many athletes and older people take it. But I think we'd better write it down. We'll let the doctor decide.
It's not prescription.
I know, but we'll let the doctor decide. Better to be safe than sorry, don't you think?
Yes. I suppose so.
And, uh...Have you ever had or been treated for rheumatic fever?
No.
Heart trouble?
No.
Hepatitis A or B?
No.
HIV / AIDS?
No.
And do you smoke?
No.
Do you drink alcohol?
Yes, a little.
More than six ounces a day?
No, not that much.
OK. And uh...What are your symptoms today?
Well. My stomach feels awful. Like I'm going to throw up, you know. And I, I think I've got a fever. Anyway, I feel hot. I was really sweating when I woke up this morning. And, umm... I guess that's it, really.
Any diarrhea or constipation?
No, no. I had a...
... a bowel movement?
Yes. This morning.
And your menstrual cycle?
Oh, my period won't start for about two weeks yet.
All right. I guess that's it for right now. If you'll wait over there, the doctor will see you in just a moment or two.
Uh...um... Could I drink anything? Is it OK if I get myself an orange juice or something?
Sure, if you feel like it.
Uh, I don't really, no. But I thought I'd just try it to settle my stomach. I dunno.
Well, if the juice doesn't work, the restrooms are right over there.
Oh dear... now I don't...
Morning, Anouk!
who is distracted; he is fiddling with his computer set up): Huh? Oh. Oh hi, Wendy. How are you today?
Good, thanks. Uh...what, what're you doing in class so early? Can I...?
I'm...I need to use Power Point this morning, but-- for my presentation, y'know?-- but I can't...I can't...it won't boot, and...
Can I help you somehow?
Uh, no, I don't think so, thanks. Or...darn! Well, I've checked all the cabling here twice. See? -- it's plugged into the USB port all right...here and-- at the projector, here...
Yeah. Yeah, they seem OK to me too. And the AC?
Oh. Yes, it's fine.
Yes, it's in there OK. And...you turned on the computer, didn't you?
Huh? Yes. No... well, sure, but-- I just leave the power switch on all the time. Actually, I don't even remember...
...where it is? Heh! It should be here, on the side...about here... Uh, no. What is this, anyway? A Sony, eh? Hmm. Maybe...yeah, here it is, over here. They always hide them, don't they?
I didn't know where it was. I never use it.
There, it's on... No, I think I've turned it off now. There-- it's on now. It should be.
All right, good...um... No, nothing.
It takes a minute to boot up, Anouk. At least mine does. Windows Seven?
No, XP. I hear Seven is not so good.
Really? I think you're thinking of Vista. I've got Seven and I like it a lot. So far, anyway. I got it for Christmas.
Yeah? Well, anyway, I'm sticking with Windows XP for now. I'm comfortable with it, and I've got no complaints... But I don't see it yet.
Nothing, eh?
Nope, nothing.
Uh. OK, then...what else? It was working OK in your room, wasn't it?
Oh yes, sure. I practiced my presentation last night, and it was running just fine. Where's that power switch again? Here?... Um. Yeah, it's on, all right. Now what?
And the power goes to...um...where? Oh, the outlet here on the lectern. And...
Yeah, this's just how the professor sets his up. I don't get it.
But-- is this outlet on? I mean-- where does it plug in, anyway?
Huh? I never-- ah! Down here. And-- that's it! The lectern's not plugged in! Into this floor socket, see? Damn...There, now how's that?
Let's see. Hang on now...There! There she is!
Hey! There she is indeed! Great! Thanks, Wendy, thanks a lot. Electricity-- phooey! When are they going to make electricity wireless, anyway?
Can they do that?
Do what?
Make it wireless. Give us electricity with no wires, no plugs, no extension cords.
Well, I think so, yes. We can transfer electrical power by induction, can't we?
I dunno. What's that? What's 'induction'?
Didn't you take any physics? How'd you get into this course, anyway? You remember-- magnetic fields. You remember the experiment where you use the magnet and a bunch of iron filings? The filings show the nice symmetric magnetic field around the magnet's poles?
Oh. Yeah. All the electrons are pointing in one direction or something, right? Just like electricity.
It IS electricity, actually. That's what electricity is-- a line of flowing electrons.
But they don't really flow anywhere, do they?
Well, no. They don't. Each electron just kind of bumps the next electron, sort of. Anyway...
Anyway, so...if they could make that happen efficiently, I mean, without much energy loss and, and... across long distances, then-- they could make electricity wireless, I guess.
Right!...Theoretically.
So-- we wouldn't need batteries anymore, for one thing. No more dead batteries. No more pollution from discarded batteries-- that'd be good.
Yeah-- except when you're out in the woods or somewhere. Your camping equipment, your flashlight and-- you know-- you'd be too far from an electricity source, even a wireless source. You'd need batteries.
Yeah, I guess. But not if we were in the city, say.
No.
And we wouldn't need a cord that we might forget to plug in.
Oh, very funny.
So are you all set up now? Your presentation is first, isn't it? What's it about again?
Um...I call it "Research Planning: Catching all the Details before you Start". Guess I should pay better attention to my own presentation, shouldn't I?
 Maybe. Good luck with it, Anouk. I'll be rooting for you.
Thanks!
yeah i'm preparing myself to drop a lot on this man, but definitely need something reliable
